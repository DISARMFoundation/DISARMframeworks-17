| [T0146 Account Asset](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0146.md) | <i>Williams, best known to audiences for his iconic role as Star Wars’ Lando Calrissian, announced Sunday that he had been hacked and that a number of recent politically-charged posts on his page were not his own (T0146: Account Asset, T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0145.005: Compromised Persona).<br><br>“My friends, I want to let you know that my account was recently hacked,” Williams wrote on Facebook Sunday. “Several unauthorized posts were not legitimate.”<br><br>Facebook post data compiled by PressProgress shows that over a three-day period between September 10 and September 13, Williams’ official verified Facebook page made 66 posts in reference to Charlie Kirk. These posts were collectively shared over 70,000 times and received over 1.6 million likes and other reactions.<br><br>Williams had been an infrequent social media user until September 10, when the 88-year-old actor’s Facebook page suddenly posted a “May the Fourth be with you” message to confused fans, prompting one to reply: “It’s September, Billy.”<br><br>For three days, the Star Wars actor’s page became obsessively fixated on Charlie Kirk’s murder (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), posting dozens of times per day about Kirk, including posts equating the slain activist to Abraham Lincoln, JFK, Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesus Christ. Another post predicted retribution against “leftists.”<br><br>[...]<br><br>In a statement to PressProgress on Saturday afternoon, Billy Dee Williams’ management team confirmed that the Star Wars actor’s Facebook page had been compromised and that they were having difficulty regaining control.<br><br>“Unfortunately Mr. Williams’ official Facebook account was hacked,” the actor’s representative told PressProgress. “Please note that all of the recent posts you’ve seen are fraudulent and in no way reflect Mr. Williams’ views, opinions or affiliations.” (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)<br><br>[...]<br><br>One post, shared while police were still hunting for the suspect, provided the wrong name of the alleged shooter (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0160.002: Information is False). Another post shared a fake screenshot of a non-existent tweet from Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger lamenting the death of Charlie Kirk and predicting the return of Jesus Christ (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).</i> |
