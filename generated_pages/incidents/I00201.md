| [T0161.002 Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0161.002.md) | <i>Social media users have been sharing images online that attribute various quotes to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Reuters could not find evidence that these any of these quotes are accurate (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>[...]<br><br>The image reads: “’You need to vote for the Democrats, otherwise the illegal aliens will lose their rights.’ – Nancy Pelosi (2019), ‘No ordinary American cares about Constitutional rights.’ – Joe Biden, And my personal favorite: ‘Owning guns is not a right. If it were a right, it would be in the Constitution.’ – Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (2018)”<br><br>The image doesn’t say where or when any of the alleged comments were made.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Reuters could not find any records of Speaker Pelosi saying “’You need to vote for the Democrats, otherwise the illegal aliens will lose their rights. (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)”<br><br>A Google search brings up pages using this quote with no attribution to a source.<br><br>In a press conference in June 2018, Pelosi told a reporter that using terminology like “illegal alien” is not constructive. The video is available on C-SPAN. Her exact words can be heard around the 15:30 mark. It is therefore unlikely that Pelosi would have used the terminology in the alleged quote. <br><br>[...]<br><br>Reuters found no evidence former Vice President Biden ever said the words “No ordinary American cares about Constitutional rights. (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)” <br><br>Some forums and posts featuring the article link to a Breitbart article that reads, “Biden: No Ordinary American Cares About Their Constitutional Rights, Facebook Questions are Plants”. The article mentions a February 21, 2013 forum at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury where then Vice President Biden spoke about gun control.<br><br>A video on the New York Times website shows Biden’s speech at the university. The closest to the quote in the claim can be seen round the 11:10 mark: “No law-abiding citizen in the United States of America has any fear that their constitutional rights will be infringed in any way. None, zero.”<br><br>The actual quote is significantly different to the quote in this claim. Biden did not say “No ordinary American cares about their constitutional rights”. (T0162: Reframe Context, T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)<br><br>[...]<br><br>“Owning guns is not a right. If it were a right, it would be in the constitution.”<br><br>Reuters could not find any record of Ocasio-Cortez saying this. The social media posts do not provide any context or other information about the purported quote (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>Ocasio-Cortez clarified her stance on the second amendment on the right to keep and bear arms while answering questions on a Reddit thread when she was running as a candidate for Congress in 2017: <br><br>“Combating domestic terrorism? Keep the severely mentally ill and people with a history of domestic abuse from purchasing guns. I am a believer in the second amendment, but this is where I draw the line.”<br><br>On her website, she calls for “common sense gun reform with the goal of eliminating gun violence and saving lives”<br><br>It is unlikely that, as a Congresswoman, Ocasio-Cortez would not be aware of the existence and meaning of the second amendment.<br><br>Reuters previously debunked the Biden and Ocasio-Cortez quotes (T0160.007: Claim Previously Fact Checked), along with other false quotes attributed to prominent Democrats.</i> |
