| [T0160.004 Information is Misleading](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0160.004.md) | <i>A misleading (T0160.004: Information is Misleading) comparison of Antarctic sea ice levels on two specific days 27 years apart has been used by people online to falsely (T0160.002: Information is False) claim that climate change warnings are a scam.<br><br>Two satellite images were published alongside each other in Facebook and X posts, pointing out that sea ice levels in the Antarctic were similar in 1997 and 2024.<br><br>They ended the posts with “#climatescam”, implying the images are evidence global warming is a hoax.<br><br>Citing data from the University of Colorado Boulder’s National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), the users said Antarctica’s sea ice extent reached 3.08 million square kilometres on March 9, 1997, compared with 3.17 million square kilometres on the same date in 2024.<br><br>The NSIDC told Reuters via email these figures do not match its records (T0164.001: Narrative Presents Fabricated Statistics as Genuine Data). It said the five-day average sea ice extent was 2.76 million square kilometres on March 9, 1997, and 2.80 million square kilometres on March 9, 2024.<br><br>Two other climate experts who spoke to Reuters said “cherry-picked” dates comparing Antarctica’s sea ice extent would also not provide an accurate picture by itself of Earth’s changing climate (T0164.002: Narrative Uses Selective Statistics to Support Claim). This is because it would fail to show long-term trends, but also because scientists are unsure how climate change is affecting sea ice in this area of the planet.<br><br>Antarctic sea ice levels in 1997 were, alongside 1993, at their lowest that decade, according to an interactive chart from the NSIDC.<br><br>Longer-term data show the sea ice extent slightly increased up until 2015 before dropping from 2017. In 2023 it hit a record low.<br><br>The drop since 2017 has caught experts’ attention but it is not yet clear if this is related to climate change, said University of Exeter climate professor James Screen, who spoke to Reuters by telephone.<br><br>“The sea ice has been steady for several decades and then we have seen a sudden decline, and scientists are now trying to understand whether this is now a signal emerging of climate change-driven loss or whether this is another kind of temporary blip," he said.<br><br>Screen said the trend has puzzled scientists for a while, and it can’t be solved by looking at two single data points and saying one is higher than the other.<br><br>He said of the social media posts: “They just cherry-pick a couple of random points on a time series and try and use that to make a claim that is unsubstantiated in a long-term perspective."
