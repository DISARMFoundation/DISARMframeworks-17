# Incident I00130: Images of a ‘Palestinian girl’ being rescued were taken in Syria in 2016

* **Summary:** <i>What was claimed: A series of images show the same Palestinian girl being saved by three different rescuers on three different days at three different locations 50 km apart from each other.<br><br>Our verdict: If taken literally, this claim is not true. These pictures were actually taken in Aleppo, Syria, in the aftermath of a bombing that took place on 27 August 2016. We have not seen reports showing the same Palestinian girl being rescued three times.</i>
