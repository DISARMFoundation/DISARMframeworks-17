# Incident I00238: Telegraph headline misrepresents estimate of foreign aid spent within UK

* **Summary:** <i>What was claimed: Over half of the foreign aid budget is spent in the UK.<br><br>Our verdict: This is misleading. It is based on a think tank estimate that the amount of UK foreign aid spent in the UK itself accounted for half of bilateral aid spending in 2023. This would equate to around a third of total UK foreign aid spending.</i>
