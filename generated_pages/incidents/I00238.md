# Incident I00238: Telegraph headline misrepresents estimate of foreign aid spent within UK

* **Summary:** <i>What was claimed: Over half of the foreign aid budget is spent in the UK.<br><br>Our verdict: This is misleading. It is based on a think tank estimate that the amount of UK foreign aid spent in the UK itself accounted for half of bilateral aid spending in 2023. This would equate to around a third of total UK foreign aid spending.</i>

They’re based on a think tank estimate that the amount of UK foreign aid spent in the UK itself accounted for half of bilateral aid spending in 2023, rather than all foreign aid spending (T0164.003: Narrative Uses Misinterpreted Statistics to Support Claim). This distinction is made clearer later in the Telegraph article (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content).
