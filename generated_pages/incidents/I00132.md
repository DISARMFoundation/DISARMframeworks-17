| [T0160.002 Information is False](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0160.002.md) | <i>A video of an apparent funeral procession where what appears to be a corpse suddenly runs away when an alarm rings out is being shared with a misleading claim that it shows people “scared of Israel’s drones”.<br><br>During the video, a group appear to be carrying a shrouded body, which they put down and run away from when a siren sounds. The ‘dead body’ then also gets up and runs off, to laughter from the person filming.<br><br>The footage has been shared with the caption: “Even dead are scared of Israel’s Drones [sic].” That suggests the video shows people being targeted by Israeli drones, possibly in Gaza or Lebanon given current events in the Middle East. But this is not the case (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>The video was actually filmed in Jordan (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location) in 2020 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current), during the Covid-19 pandemic. It was reported by an Arabic-language news channel on 25 March 2020, and the same video was also published on Facebook on 23 March 2020 by a Jordanian news outlet.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Although we’ve not been able to verify for certain what the video shows, it was filmed in the early days of the pandemic when strict Covid-19 rules were in place. Lockdown restrictions were implemented nationwide in Jordan in March 2020, which included an army-enforced curfew and closures of borders with neighbouring countries.<br><br>The fact that the video includes a supposed corpse moving also appears to echo a narrative, often referred to as ‘Pallywood’ (a portmanteau of Palestine and Bollywood), which is used by some online to describe the alleged false staging of harm to Palestinian civilians (T0162: Reframe Context). <br><br>Full Fact has debunked a number of videos and photos that were posted with misleading claims they showed Palestinians pretending to be dead or injured during the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict.<br><br>This video has been previously debunked by other fact checking organisations (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked), when it was claimed to show various different instances of Palestinians faking injuries, as far back as 2021.</i> |
