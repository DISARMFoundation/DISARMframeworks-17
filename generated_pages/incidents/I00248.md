# Incident I00248: Woman's deepfake betrayal by close friend: 'Every moment turned into porn'

* **Summary:** <i>It was a warm February night when an ominous message popped into Hannah Grundy's inbox in Sydney.<br><br>"I will just keep emailing because I think this is worthy of your attention," the anonymous sender wrote.<br><br>Inside was a link, and a warning in bold: "[This] contains disturbing material."<br><br>She hesitated for a moment, fearing it was a scam.<br><br>The reality was so much worse. The link contained pages and pages of fake pornography featuring Hannah, alongside detailed rape fantasies and violent threats.<br><br>"You're tied up in them," she recalls. "You look afraid. You've got tears in your eyes. You're in a cage."<br><br>Written in kitschy word art on some images was Hannah's full name. Her Instagram handle was posted, as was the suburb she lived in. She would later learn her phone number had also been given out.<br><br>That email kicked off a saga Hannah likens to a movie. She was left to become her own detective, uncovering a sickening betrayal by someone close to her, and building a case which changed her life - and Australian legal standards.</i>

The link contained pages and pages of fake pornography featuring Hannah, alongside detailed rape fantasies and violent threats. (T0166.002: Sexual Deepfake Impersonation, T0048.010: Threaten Physical Sexual Violence)<br><br>"You're tied up in them," she recalls. "You look afraid. You've got tears in your eyes. You're in a cage."<br><br>Written in kitschy word art on some images was Hannah's full name. Her Instagram handle was posted, as was the suburb she lived in. She would later learn her phone number had also been given out (T0048.004: Dox).<br><br>That email kicked off a saga Hannah likens to a movie. She was left to become her own detective, uncovering a sickening betrayal by someone close to her, and building a case which changed her life - and Australian legal standards.<br><br>The web page was called "The Destruction of Hannah", and at the top of it was a poll where hundreds of people had voted on the vicious ways they wanted to abuse her (T0029: Online Polls).<br><br>Below was a thread of more than 600 vile photos, with Hannah's face stitched on to them. Buried in between them were chilling threats.<br><br>"I'm closing in on this slut," the main poster said.<br><br>"I want to hide in her house and wait until she is alone, grab her from behind and... feel her struggle." (T0048.009: Threaten Physical Violence)<br><br>It's been three years now, but the 35-year-old school teacher has no trouble recalling the "pure shock" that coursed through when she and partner Kris Ventura, 33, opened the page.<br><br>"You immediately feel unsafe," Hannah tells me, eyes wide as she grips a mug of peppermint tea in her living room.<br><br>Clicking through the website Kris had also found photos of their close friends, along with images depicting at least 60 other women, many also from Sydney.<br><br>The couple quickly realised the pictures used to create the deepfakes were from the women's private social media accounts. And the penny dropped: this was someone they all knew.</i> |
