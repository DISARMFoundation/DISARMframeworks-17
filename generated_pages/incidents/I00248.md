* **Summary:** <i>It was a warm February night when an ominous message popped into Hannah Grundy's inbox in Sydney.<br><br>"I will just keep emailing because I think this is worthy of your attention," the anonymous sender wrote.<br><br>Inside was a link, and a warning in bold: "[This] contains disturbing material."<br><br>She hesitated for a moment, fearing it was a scam.<br><br>The reality was so much worse. The link contained pages and pages of fake pornography featuring Hannah, alongside detailed rape fantasies and violent threats.<br><br>"You're tied up in them," she recalls. "You look afraid. You've got tears in your eyes. You're in a cage."<br><br>Written in kitschy word art on some images was Hannah's full name. Her Instagram handle was posted, as was the suburb she lived in. She would later learn her phone number had also been given out.<br><br>That email kicked off a saga Hannah likens to a movie. She was left to become her own detective, uncovering a sickening betrayal by someone close to her, and building a case which changed her life - and Australian legal standards.</i>
