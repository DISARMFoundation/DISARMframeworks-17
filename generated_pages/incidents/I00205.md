| [T0161.002 Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0161.002.md) | <i>After Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's trip to Cancun, Mexico, as his home state dealt with an unprecedented winter storm, an image went viral purporting to show a tweet on climate change made by the Republican in 2016. <br><br>The post, shared on Facebook by many users across the platform, claims Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted, "I'll believe in climate change when Texas freezes over." (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)<br><br>The post claims the tweet was sent at 5:44 p.m. on Sept. 8, 2016, and the profile picture and blue checkmark seen in the image matches the one displayed on Cruz's official Twitter profile. <br><br>"There's always a tweet," one Facebook user wrote in a post that has more than 400 shares. "This 2016 Ted Cruz Tweet did not age well, and it has also frozen solid," another user wrote Feb. 19 in a post with more than 800 shares.<br><br>USA TODAY was unable to reach the Facebook users who shared the image for comment. <br><br>A search for the purported climate change tweet on Cruz's personal account, @tedcruz, and his official Twitter page, @SenTedCruz, results in no matches.<br><br>There is no record of the tweet on ProPublica's Politwoops database that tracks deleted tweets by elected officials. <br><br>The tweet does not appear in archived versions of Cruz's Twitter page from September 2016 using the Internet Wayback Machine. <br><br>Steve Guest, a communication adviser for Cruz, confirmed to Factcheck.org in an email that the tweet is fabricated. USA TODAY was unable to reach Cruz's office for comment. </i> |
