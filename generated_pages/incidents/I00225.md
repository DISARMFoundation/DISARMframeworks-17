| [T0146.007 Automated Account Asset](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0146.007.md) | <i>Target Audience 1: Media Organizations, Fact-Checkers, and Researchers <br><br>US and international media organizations, fact-checkers, and researchers are almost certainly the primary target audience of Operation Overload, based on industry research, recent credible testimonials from various media organizations, and Operation Overload automated social media accounts (T0146.007: Automated Account Asset) that tag media organizations, request fact-checking verification (T0039.002: Solicit Production of Fact Check), and reply to social media posts from these organizations with spam (T0049.008: Generate Information Pollution). These individuals and organizations themselves are at risk of brand abuse and potential impersonation. Similarly to the Russia-linked influence operation Doppelgänger, Operation Overload frequently abuses logos and stylized wordmarks of US and international media organisations (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). Known tracked organizations impersonated in Operation Overload per Insikt Group’s investigation are available in Appendix A. <br><br>According to CheckFirst, between August 2023 and May 2024, Eastern European fact-checking and counter-propaganda outlets, particularly in Ukraine, were among those “most actively engaged” in publishing debunks of Operation Overload content. Though the reported trend demonstrated Eastern European-based researchers as at the forefront of combatting Russian propaganda, there were concerns about whether these organizations were effectively collaborating on incoming leads. <br><br>Objective 1: Overwhelm Target’s Research Resources <br><br>CheckFirst research indicated that Operation Overload aims to overwhelm journalists and fact-checkers with persistent, spam-like requests to verify the operation’s inauthentic content (T0039.002: Solicit Production of Fact Check), diverting resources from pursuing legitimate investigations and debunking Russian disinformation. The operation almost certainly seeks to inundate media, fact-checkers, and researchers’ resources — both time and personnel — causing time-sensitive, critical, legitimate investigations to be overlooked or delayed (T0049.008: Generate Information Pollution). This tactic creates confusion and distraction, ensuring that key narratives or investigative avenues slip through unnoticed, enabling mis- and disinformation to spread unchallenged. By leading journalists and fact-checkers into pursuing fake fact-checking leads or failing to verify legitimate information, the operation exhausts the capacity of the aforementioned organizations, diminishing their ability to verify accurate information. <br><br>Objective 2: Use Target to Launder Disinformation into Mainstream Discourse <br><br>In pursuing Objective 1, Operation Overload very likely also hopes to use media organizations as a means of information laundering; more specifically, to inject malign content and pro-Kremlin narratives into mainstream political discourse via trusted parties. Should a member of Target Audience 1 3 unintentionally fact-check and publish a report using Operation Overload's fake leads, there is an added risk of giving additional legitimacy to the false story and lending credibility to the operation’s broader themes, increasing the likelihood that audiences will believe it, and pushing malign influence deeper into mainstream discourse (T0039: Bait Influencer).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Insikt Group has observed several instances of Operation Overload content negatively depicting Vice President Harris, the Harris campaign, and members of Vice President Harris’s immediate family in a manner we assess is very likely aimed at undermining her candidacy for president (T0135: Undermine). We have also observed Operation Overload negatively depicting the candidacy of former President Trump, though based on our ongoing collection of Operation Overload content, content negative of Vice President Harris is at least four times more frequent than negative portrayals of former President Trump. Targeting each candidate with content intended to damage their reputation is consistent with historic Russia-linked influence operations against major US elections. We assess that the significant disparity between the level of targeting of each candidate likely indicates whose policies the Kremlin perceives to be better aligned with its strategic objectives. <br><br>To illustrate how Operation Overload targets Vice President Harris’s campaign, one video, impersonating the BBC on Telegram, falsely claimed her campaign lost over $1.2 million on “non-existent advertising services” (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Operation Overload has also produced limited content that discredits the Trump campaign with false claims. For instance, one video impersonating the BBC falsely claimed that former President Trump had received an endorsement from Norwegian neo-Nazi Anders Behring Breivik (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>In another instance, a video impersonating a Fox News brief published on the “Gagauz Republic” Telegram account falsely claimed that Yum! Brands filed a lawsuit against the Harris campaign to prevent it from using Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) in its advertisements (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). The video cited an inauthentic quote attributed to Lexington, Kentucky attorney, J. Dale Golden, who suggested the Trump campaign pressured Yum! Brands to file the fictitious lawsuit, alleging Trump was concerned Harris would attract African-American voters with the KFC brand. The video, using Golden’s likeness, further attempted to reinforce racial stereotypes by stating, “and we all know who enjoys KFC more than anyone else” (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Operation Overload-affiliated social media accounts, as well as Russian-language Telegram accounts posting inauthentic videos deceptively attributed to reliable “sources”, have published clips that vilify Ukrainian refugees in the US as purveyors of crime, drugs, and disease (T0135.001: Smear). For example, video segments impersonating US-based CNN recently suggested that a “Ukrainian woman with HIV infected more than 200 American men” and that “an influx of Ukrainian refugees” resulted in an increase in violence in Los Angeles’s Skid Row neighborhood (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). In a video impersonating USA Today, Operation Overload assets claimed that Ukrainian refugees “are being used to transport fentanyl” into the US (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Operation Overload very likely attempts to provoke negative sentiment in the US toward the LGBTQIA+ community (T0135.004: Polarise), using disinformation to perpetuate discriminatory beliefs around transgender individuals, perceived behavioral issues, gender transition and reassignment surgeries, and pharmaceutical treatments. One video published in September 2024, impersonating The Washington Post, claimed that LGBTQIA+ families are more likely to be approved for adoption than traditional families, citing fabricated data from the National Children's Bureau (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0164.001: Narrative Presents Fabricated Statistics as Genuine Data).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Professional Imposter <br><br>Operation Overload deploys a range of professional and multi-layered techniques to build credibility and disseminate influence content. The operation’s initial layer to build credibility stems from its repeated misuse of a media organization's brand, including abuse of an organization’s logo, emulation of the brand’s graphics packages for visual media, and attempts to attribute its videos to journalists employed by the impersonated media organization (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). <br><br>The video content from Operation Overload is crafted as if it was found on a legitimate organization’s social media account. The videos are short (one to two minutes in length), incorporate background news audio (sometimes referred to as a “news bed”), and incorporate real footage and static images pulled from publicly available sources. For example, an impersonation of the BBC published on September 20, 2024 (Figure 3), recycled a photograph Vice President Harris posted to her social media account on September 8, 2024, to commemorate National Grandparents Day in the US (T0084.002: Plagiarise Content). <br><br>Further, the videos often cite inauthentic research or investigation findings from reputable organizations and fabricated testimonials attributed to professionals in the corresponding field to falsely appeal to authority and add a layer of legitimacy to the video content (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). For example, many documented videos we attribute to Operation Overload have cited fake research from Bellingcat, almost certainly attempting to exploit the organization’s established credibility as a reputable investigative outlet. <br><br>Insta-imposed <br><br>As demonstrated in Figures 18–23, Operation Overload creates static media that appears to be screenshots taken of Instagram Stories from real media organizations. These fabricated screenshots often include a tagged article link edited onto the image to provide an additional layer of legitimacy (T0122: Direct Users to Alternative Platforms). <br><br>Instagram overlays were mostly used to produce content covering fake graffiti (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage) from multiple angles; these images are similar to other fake graffiti campaigns purportedly across Europe, documented in AFP’s initial analysis as well as in CheckFirst research, which found the “graffiti paintings are deceptively superimposed onto authentic photos of urban landscapes … from places in Germany and France”. Recent examples targeting US audiences, as shown in the following figures, indicate Operation Overload's attempts to attribute the graffiti to legitimate artists, likely to bolster the images’ credibility (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). <br><br>There is a persistent risk that Operation Overload may expand to impersonating additional online video-centric platforms. In early October 2024, Insikt Group located an Operation Overload video on a mainstream social media platform impersonating a YouTube Short posted by US telecommunications company AT&T (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.205: Business Persona). The AT&T impersonation video urged “viewers” of the YouTube Short to “vote for Harris if you want kids’ [expletive] to be cut” and “vote for Trump if you want prices to be cut”.<br><br>Amplification and Automation Operation <br><br>Overload very likely seeks to amplify its content through CIB, documented email campaigns, and promotion through pro-Kremlin social media personalities. Operation Overload also uses hashtags, such as #BBC, #FoxNews, or #USATODAY, in its posts to increase content views (T0015.001: Use Existing Hashtag). Likewise, we located accounts that directly tag media or other related media organizations and political figures (T0039: Bait Influencer), including persistent requests to verify the videos (T0039.002: Solicit Production of Fact Check), with the likely goal of supplementing the operation’s email campaigns. Notably, the method of reply spam activity is strongly similar to Insikt Group’s observations of the Doppelgänger network in the fall of 2023 and into 2024. <br><br>Insikt Group assesses that many individual social media accounts engaged in persistent social media amplification and CIB to promote Operation Overload content were likely compromised and repurposed for automated engagement boosting (T0146.007: Automated Account Asset, T0150.005: Compromised Asset). This analysis is based on Operation Overload using “aged” accounts, including some that had their original posts from several years ago, often in local languages. The accounts would go dormant for several years and then are suddenly reactivated (T0150.002: Dormant Asset). The social media accounts frequently boost content unrelated to Operation Overload, including likely engagement farming related to cryptocurrency and NFTs. Currently, Insikt Group assesses that the automated accounts are likely services provided by outsourced entities commissioned by the administrators of Operation Overload that advertise social media promotion and engagement boosting. However, additional research on these networks engaged in CIB will be required for further confirmation.<br><br>AI Voiceover Usage <br><br>Insikt Group has observed some videos we attribute to Operation Overload employing the use of AI-generated voiceovers to narrate its content, stylistically similar to a news broadcast or reporting from a legitimate journalist (T0166: AI-Generated Content, T0088: Develop Audio-Based Content). More specifically, the administrators of Operation Overload appear to prefer combining AI-generated voiceovers with content impersonating USA Today, as well as content in Ukrainian. Operation Overload may attempt to integrate AI-generated voiceovers into other content impersonating other media entities.<br><br>QR-edibility <br><br>Social media “seed” accounts that initially post Operation Overload content regularly incorporate the use of QR codes in their posts, almost certainly to aid in establishing credibility for the inauthentic video. The QR codes (T0153.004: QR Code Asset), often marked as “verified”, redirect to the homepage of a trusted organization (such as the BBC, VIGINUM, and so on). Some of these QR codes have previously redirected to a seemingly benign payload hosted on the IP address 127.255.255[.]254. Although benign at the time of writing, we recommend avoiding scanning instances of such QR codes identified in the wild, as they can be leveraged in the future for delivering malware or other malicious activities.<br><br>Insikt Group can further confirm CheckFirst’s own analysis of the QR codes, including Operation Overload’s use of the QR code management tool, me-qr[.]com. Further analysis from CheckFirst indicated that the QR codes were possibly managed by an individual connected to Otri, a Russian marketing agency.</i> |
