| [T0162.004 Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0162.004.md) | <i>A viral video is being shared on social media with the claim it shows the Gaza Strip following the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas. But it actually comes from Algiers (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location) and predates events in October 2023 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current). The clip is likely to actually show celebrations from football fans (T0162: Reframe Context).<br><br>The video shows a skyline illuminated in red with thousands of small fires and the sound of explosions. It has been shared across social media platforms, including Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok with the claim it shows the Gaza Strip.<br><br>Multiple posts have the caption: “If Russia did this in Kiev it would be all over the news and everyone would be screaming "genocide", but it's happening in Gaza and no one cares about the civilian casualties.” Another post claims it is an “old video from Gaza”. <br><br>However, the video does not show either current or past events in the Gaza Strip (T0160.002: Information is False). The lights and explosions appear to be fireworks and flares.<br><br>Journalists at Bellingcat located the clip to Algiers using a roundabout and billboard that can be seen in the background of the footage, which has also been verified by fact checkers at Reuters. The video was also reportedly first posted to TikTok on 28 September—but has since been deleted—and was reshared on YouTube that same day, predating the recent conflict that began on 7 October. <br><br>While the specific context of the clip is not absolutely clear, footage showing similar scenes was posted online on 8 August 2023 in celebration of the 102nd anniversary of Algiers-based football club Mouloudia Alger. There are several other videos showing Algerian football fans celebrating with bright red fireworks on many different occasions dating as far back as 2014.</i> |
