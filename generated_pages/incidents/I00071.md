| [T0085.004 Develop Document](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0085.004.md) | <i>On August 16, 2022, pro-Kremlin Telegram channel Joker DPR (Джокер ДНР) published a forged letter allegedly written by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.111: Government Official Persona). In the letter, Kuleba supposedly asked relevant Polish authorities to rename Belwederska Street in Warsaw — the location of the Russian embassy building — as Stepan Bandera Street, in honor of the far-right nationalist who led the Ukrainian Insurgent Army during WWII.<br><br>More than sixty years after his death, Bandera remains a polarizing figure. While still highly regarded in far-right Ukrainian nationalist circles, he is largely remembered for his role in the massacres of Polish civilians and collaborating with Nazi officials. In Russia, the word Banderite has become synonymous with “fascist” or even “Nazi.” During the early months of the war in Ukraine, Kremlin propaganda spoke of “de-nazifying” Ukraine and removing its democratically elected government, which it referred to contemptuously as “Banderite.”<br><br>The forged letter claimed that renaming the street after Bandera would be seen as a gesture of support to Ukraine, and highlighted that Russia changed the names of the streets in Moscow where the US and UK embassies are located. The letter is not dated, and Dmytro Kuleba’s signature seems to be copied from a publicly available letter signed by him in 2021.<br><br>The day after releasing the letter, Joker DPR published another document on Telegram, allegedly signed by Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.111: Government Official Persona). The document contained several orders supposedly issued by Przydacz, including an order for the President of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance to provide a written expert opinion by August 31 about the possibility of changing the street in Warsaw to Stepan Bandera Street. It also proposed to conduct a publicity campaign to improve Bandera’s popularity among Polish citizens, despite his role in WWII-era Polish massacres.<br><br>Deputy Foreign Minister Przydac wrote on Twitter that the document published under his name was forged and that no one at the Polish Foreign Ministry had written such a letter. “It’s a fake,” he tweeted. “Never would such a magazine be created by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The linguistic errors clearly point to the potential authors of this provocation.”<br><br>The August 17 Telegram post also contained screenshots of Facebook posts that appeared on two Facebook accounts belonging to Polish nationals Piotr Górka, an expert in the history of the Polish Air Force, and Dariusz Walusiak, a Polish historian and documentary maker. The Górka post suggested that he fully supported the Polish government’s decision to change Belwederska Street to Stepan Bandera Street.<br><br>In a statement to the DFRLab, Górka said his account was accessed without his consent (T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0145.005: Compromised Persona, T0097.101: Local Persona, T0097.108: Expert Persona). “This is not my post loaded to my Facebook page, (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)” he explained. “My site was hacked, some days ago.” At the time of publishing, Piotr Górka’s post and his Facebook account were no longer accessible.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The fact that Joker DPR’s Telegram post included screenshots of their Facebook posts raises the strong possibility that both Facebook accounts were compromised, and that hackers planted false statements on their pages that would seem out of character for them in order to gain further attention to the forged documents (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).</i> |
