# Incident I00228: Rosie Holt: the satirist whose ‘Tory MP’ video had so many fooled

* **Summary:** <i>At a glance, Holt may be hard to distinguish from the declining number of Tory MPs prepared to stand up for the prime minister, but she is in fact a satirist – an actor and comedian with a strong line in parodies of the political speech that veers into drivel. This video sketch has taken off – 6 million views on Twitter so far – partly because “an awful lot of people” think it’s real, she said.</i>

| [T0068 Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0068.md) | <i>The video was, according to former Ukip leader Henry Bolton, evidence of the declining quality of MPs. Anthony Grayling, the philosopher, described her as a “bald-faced emetic” and Philip Pullman, the author, said he was “aghast”.<br><br>Their collective outrage was directed at the words of Rosie Holt who, asked by an interviewer whether she attended any of the Downing Street parties, said that until Sue Gray completes her report “your guess is as good as mine: I don’t know whether I attended the party” (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>Holt added: “If there was a party in lockdown when we told everyone they couldn’t even attend funerals, but no one knew about it, was there a party?”<br><br>At a glance, Holt may be hard to distinguish from the declining number of Tory MPs prepared to stand up for the prime minister, but she is in fact a satirist (T0097.110: Party Official Persona, T0143.004: Parody Persona) – an actor and comedian with a strong line in parodies of the political speech that veers into drivel. This video sketch (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0160.005: Content Produced as Satire) has taken off – 6 million views on Twitter so far – partly because “an awful lot of people” think it’s real, she said.<br><br>“I don’t go in there to hoodwink people,” she told the Observer. “I get a bit unnerved when lots of people think it’s real because that’s not what I’m trying to do.<br><br>“But there’s also an awful lot of people who do get it. And I’m quite good at screening out the negative stuff. Some people say ‘oh, you shouldn’t joke about things like this – it’s a serious subject’.<br><br>“But I’m a big believer in laughing at things that make you sad and angry. And there’s so many things happening with this government at the moment there is always just so much material.”<br><br>This particular video was created by splicing Holt’s footage with questions from a Sky News reporter to Boris Johnson in which he dodged questions about whether he had gone to the 20 May 2020 garden party (T0162.002: Edits Made to News Report which Reframe Context).</i> |
