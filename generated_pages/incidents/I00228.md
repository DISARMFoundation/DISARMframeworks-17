# Incident I00228: Rosie Holt: the satirist whose ‘Tory MP’ video had so many fooled

* **Summary:** <i>At a glance, Holt may be hard to distinguish from the declining number of Tory MPs prepared to stand up for the prime minister, but she is in fact a satirist – an actor and comedian with a strong line in parodies of the political speech that veers into drivel. This video sketch has taken off – 6 million views on Twitter so far – partly because “an awful lot of people” think it’s real, she said.</i>
