| [T0068 Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0068.md) | <i>President Donald Trump's permanent suspension from Twitter sent shock waves through the internet, bringing forth a mix of reactions from lawmakers, celebrities and beyond (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>While former President Barack Obama has not publicly commented on Trump's ban from the social media platform, one Facebook post claims to show his reaction.<br><br>"Man do I love having this Twitter account, the ability to connect to so many millions of people, to express my feelings and views, to know that all major media outlets and world leaders are reading these words, that they are recorded for posterity. How awesome is that?" reads a purported screenshot of a tweet from Obama.<br><br>The screenshot, which has over 1,000 shares, was shared by the Facebook page Boycott All Things Trump with the caption, "#ForeverPresident Barack Obama trolls the orange user not to be found."<br><br>The post claims the tweet was shared on Jan. 9 at 6:52 a.m., with 2,000 likes and 250 retweets. The tweet appears to have a blue checkmark and the profile image matches the one seen on Obama's official Twitter profile. However, there is no evidence that the tweet is authentic (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>The Facebook page does not have a way to be contacted.<br><br>USA TODAY found no reports of the purported tweet; it does not appear on Obama's Twitter timeline and the 44th president has not released any statement regarding Trump’s ban from the platform.<br><br>As of Jan. 11, Obama's latest tweets appear to be on Jan. 8 on the response of Capitol police to the violence that took place in Washington, D.C. <br><br>An archived page from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine of Obama's official Twitter page on Jan. 9, the day the post claims the tweet was posted, also shows no such post.</i> |
