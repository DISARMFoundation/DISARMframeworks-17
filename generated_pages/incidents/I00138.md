# Incident I00138: Images of Syrian Civil War Take on a Second Life in Gaza Conflict

* **Summary:** <i>The avalanche of disinformation shared about Israel and Palestine amid the recent conflict has been well documented. Bellingcat previously reported on the surge of misattributed videos, images, and claims — which have spread across X, TikTok, Instagram, and other social media platforms.<br><br>Bellingcat has also identified a trend of footage and images from Syria’s long-running civil war being recycled and misattributed to the current Israel-Hamas conflict. This phenomenon has also been reported by other outlets including The New York Times.  In particular, a number of prominent figures who have a history of denying the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attacks have re-shared Syrian civil war images, claiming they show Israel and Gaza. <br><br>[...]<br><br>As the current conflict between Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces has played out, prominent pro-Palestine and pro-Israel accounts have shared misrepresented footage, flooding platforms and distracting from current atrocities in the conflict.<br><br>This reuse of Syrian conflict footage means that a double erasure is occurring. Using footage from another war, rather than the evidence of Gaza today, obscures the plight of victims of both conflicts.</i>

| [T0068 Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0068.md) | <i>[Bellingcat has] identified a trend of footage and images from Syria’s long-running civil war being recycled and misattributed to the [2023] Israel-Hamas conflict. This phenomenon has also been reported by other outlets including The New York Times.  In particular, a number of prominent figures who have a history of denying the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attacks have re-shared Syrian civil war images, claiming they show Israel and Gaza. <br><br>[...]<br><br>Even beyond Pro-Assad accounts, the misuse of Syria war footage has continued across X since the latest conflict erupted in early October. In particular, there have been several videos and images shared on X misappropriating the suffering of Syrian children to spread disinformation. <br><br>For example, on October 11 a video of a young boy covered in soot crying about the death of his family was posted to X. It racked up tens of thousands of retweets and likes and millions of views. Accounts claimed that he was a Palestinian child whose sisters were killed by Israel (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>However, this video was actually of a boy in Aleppo, Syria (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location. Like the hospital video Hinkle misleadingly shared, this video originated from the Aleppo Media Center’s YouTube page, where is was shared on April 11, 2014 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current). The boy can be seen from timestamp 01:40.<br><br>In the viral version of the video on X, the AMC logo in the top left-hand corner was cropped out (T0165.002: Cropped Content, T0165.004: Source Edited Out of Content). The video had been clipped down in length (T0165.001: Clipped Content), and its colour tones adjusted (T0165: Edited Content), which aided in obscuring the original source. This was also debunked in a post on X on October 12 by Sardarizadeh, the BBC Verify journalist (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>[...]<br><br>One egregious example of misuse of images of Syrian children came from Sulaiman Ahmed, a journalist (T0097.102: Journalist Persona, T0143.001: Authentic Persona) and influencer with over 270,000 followers on X.<br><br>On October 14, Ahmed posted “CHILD GENOCIDE IN PALESTINE 614 Palestinian children murdered by the Israeli IOF Forces” (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis) along with a picture of several dead children shrouded in white cloth, on the ground, with their faces visible.<br><br>However, this gruesome image is not from Gaza but actually from Damascus (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location). The photo was taken in August 2013 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current), showing the evidence of chemical weapons attacks by pro-Assad forces as confirmed through multiple sources. In multiple articles, this photo is attributed to the aftermath of a chemical attack in Syria.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Sulaiman Ahmed also shared a video on October 13 depicting children searching for food among rubble and burnt buildings. In the post on X, he claimed that these were children in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>However, the original source of the video indicates otherwise (T0160.002: Information is False). The original creator’s TikTok handle can be seen in the video uploaded by Ahmed. Thanks to this we can see that this video was posted there on June 21, well before the start of the recent war (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current).</i> |

In particular, a number of prominent figures who have a history of denying the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attacks have re-shared Syrian civil war images, claiming they show Israel and Gaza. <br><br>[...]<br><br>On November 19, there were news reports of the death of two Palestinian journalists in Gaza, Hassouna Sleem and Sari Mansour.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, disinformation about murdered journalists appeared online. A video spread across X showing two men wearing bulletproof vests labelled “press”. The video begins with footage of rockets being fired behind the men before cutting to the same men unveiling rockets in the back of a truck. Users claimed that these were the two journalists killed in Gaza and that they were terrorists posing as journalists (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). <br><br>Among the users who shared this claim are Bree A. Dail, a correspondent for the US conservative news site Daily Wire (T0097.102: Journalist Persona, T0143.001: Authentic Persona), a user claiming to be an independent citizen journalist (T0097.102: Journalist Persona), and an account pretending to be an official account for Hamas (T0097.110: Party Official Persona, T0143.002: Fabricated Persona).<br><br>However, this video was actually filmed in Syria (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location) and was originally posted on October 7 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current). The man on the right in the video appears to be Jamil Al-Hassan, a journalist who has reported from Syria for months.<br><br>Al-Hassan posted videos and images of the same content on his X and Instagram accounts. Al-Hassan, who describes himself as a “Media activist in the Syrian revolution” on his YouTube channel, has recently reported on retaliatory shelling by the Syrian government in early October, which Bellingcat covered here.<br><br>Al-Hassan is still posting content and there have been no reports of his death (T0160.002: Information is False).</i> |

This phenomenon has also been reported by other outlets including The New York Times.  In particular, a number of prominent figures who have a history of denying the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attacks have re-shared Syrian civil war images, claiming they show Israel and Gaza. <br><br>[...]<br><br>The far-right US influencer Jackson Hinkle has quickly emerged as one of the most popular users on X during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. [...] Some of the imagery Hinkle has claimed to show Palestine was actually taken in Syria. For example, on November 12, he shared an image of a woman holding a toy car descending stairs with exposed walls and damaged infrastructure. He captioned this image “You CANNOT BREAK the Palestinian spirit.” (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>However, this photo was featured in the Siena International photography competition in 2020. It was taken by the Iranian photographer Hassan Ghaedi, who won an award for the image in the competition’s documentary and photojournalism category. According to AFP’s Fact Check, which cited Ghaedi’s social media accounts, the image was taken in 2016 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current) and shows a woman returning to a destroyed building in Homs, Syria (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location).<br><br>On November 1, Olga Robinson of BBC Verify reported that Hinkle had shared a video he claimed to be footage of Gaza’s Al-Sadaqa Hospital being bombed by Israel (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). This video depicted civilians in a hospital and a subsequent bombing and was also shared widely on X.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The clip shared by Hinkle, in fact, is an excerpt from a video that shows the bombing of the Omar Bin Abdul Aziz Hospital in Aleppo, Syria from the perspective of those inside (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location). As the Guardian reported at the time, this attack came during a 2016 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current) surge of bombing raids by Syrian regime forces and their Russian allies. The attack on the hospital was condemned by the World Health Organization (WHO).<br><br>The video is credited to the Aleppo Media Center (AMC), a Middle Eastern Independent documentary film production company. It is one of hundreds on AMC’s YouTube channel to document attacks in Syria by Syrian government forces. The relevant scene in the hospital can be seen from timestamp 00:40 (T0165.001: Clipped Content).<br><br>In the recent viral version of the video shared by Hinkle, the AMC logo had been cropped out (T0165.002: Cropped Content, T0165.004: Source Edited Out of Content).</i> |
