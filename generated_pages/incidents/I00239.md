# Incident I00239: “Deceptive” clickbait headlines: Relevance, intentions, and lies

* **Summary:** <i>Classic clickbait headlines often use hyperbolic and formulaic language to create information gaps that arouse the curiosity of readers. Such headlines are stylistically distinct from the headlines we find in traditional news media, and, as such, are easily recognisable as clickbait. However, a new type of clickbait headline has emerged which appears to have more in common stylistically with traditional newspaper headlines. Jodłowiec (2022) identifies and discusses examples of this new type of headline, referring to them as “deceptive clickbait”. She uses relevance-theoretic pragmatics to show how these headlines guide the readers to an interpretation which arouses their curiosity. On clicking, however, the readers find the content is mundane and trivial. Although these headlines are deceptive, Jodłowiec concludes that the writer has not lied, and that responsibility sits with the readers. In this article, I argue against these conclusions. I use relevance-theoretic pragmatics to show that the reader is entitled to take the high news value interpretation as the intended interpretation. Responsibility for this lies with the writer. I then consider two characterisations of the distinction between lying and misleading and show that in both cases at least some of the deceptive headlines can be considered to be lies.</i>

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”.

This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article.

They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”.

For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates.

According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed.

They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements.

While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages.

However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders.

Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness.

Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post.

Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness.

This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl.

Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story.

Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl.

While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”.

However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears.

This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower.

The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach.

For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing.

And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more.

With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled.

The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective.

Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media.

If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers.

These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline.

In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3.

Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers.

To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content).

Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3.

Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content).

As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018).

They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story.

In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap.

The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click.

Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article.

They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021).

In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021).

Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link.

In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7).

She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait.

One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible.

Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”.

This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article.

They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”.

For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609).

To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed.

While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs.

Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness.

Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness.

If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story.

To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl.

However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott.

This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany.

The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach.

For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing.

And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive?

With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled.

The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective.

They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018).

The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers.

These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media.

If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers.

These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline.

In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section.

To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team.

Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3.

To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3.

Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |
| [T0167.001 Use of Clickbait](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0167.001.md) | <i>2. Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3.
