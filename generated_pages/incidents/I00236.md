| [T0167.001 Use of Clickbait](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0167.001.md) | <i>A YouTube video falsely claims that Marcos issued the order after the veteran TV anchor supposedly insulted the President in relation to his State of the Nation Address<br><br>Claim:  President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered news anchor Mel Tiangco to leave the Philippines.<br><br>Rating: FALSE (T0160.002: Information is False)<br><br>Why we fact-checked this: The claim was made in the title and thumbnail of a YouTube video posted on July 30, which has 251,000 views, 8,600 likes, and 2,359 comments as of writing. The channel that posted the video has 746,000 subscribers and has been fact-checked by Rappler multiple times.<br><br>The video’s title reads: “JUST IN: Mga MEDIA Natameme Grabe! ang NANGYARI kay MEL TIANGCO Nataranta sa UTOS ng PRES MARCOS!”<br><br>(Just in: The media was left speechless! Mel Tiangco was shocked by the order of President Marcos!) (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait)<br><br>The video thumbnail also shows pictures of Marcos and Tiangco with the text “Pinalayas sa Pilipinas” (Expelled from the Philippines).<br><br>The bottom line: No official statements were released on Marcos’ Facebook or Twitter accounts, on Radio Television Malacañang, or the Office of the President regarding any supposed order for Tiangco to leave the country. Instead, the content of the video mainly showed comments from netizens urging Marcos to take action against the journalist for supposedly insulting him (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content).<br><br>These comments were triggered by a viral clip of Tiangco during her July 24 coverage of Marcos’ State of the Nation Address (SONA) on the GMA news program 24 Oras, where she supposedly uttered the word “pwe” which was interpreted as a sign of disrespect towards Marcos (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>Video from the GMA Integrated News YouTube channel does not show Tiangco making the exclamation. </i> |
