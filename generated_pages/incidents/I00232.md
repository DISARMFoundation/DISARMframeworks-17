| [T0151.001 Social Media Platform](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0151.001.md) | <i>Celebrity death hoaxes are spreading rapidly across social media in what experts suspect is an attempt to generate engagement for online advertising. <br><br>Dozens of pages on Facebook are making false claims that celebrities including action movie star Jason Statham and TV personality Simon Cowell have died in accidents over recent weeks.<br><br>The posts have generated tens of millions of views combined, but experts warn the fake stories are most likely engagement bait. <br><br>[An image in the article shows a screenshot of a post made to Facebook by a Page (T0151.001: Social Media Platform, T0151.003: Online Community Page) called “Celebrity Cars”. It has made a post with the following text: “SEE MORE: [url redacted] SAD NEWS: 30 minutes ago / The family announced the sad news of Action movie legend Jason Statham…” (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait). The post has an image which shows pictures of Jason Statham (including one of him in a gown on a hospital bed, presumably taken from an appearance in film or TV), and a picture of a coffin with the words “Rest in peace” overlaid]<br><br>One post shared by a page called Celebrity Cars falsely claims Statham’s family released a public statement announcing “SAD NEWS”, accompanied by a composite image of the actor next to a separate photo of a coffin and the words “rest in peace” (T0165: Edited Content).<br><br>The post links through to a website laden with advertising that includes several fake quotes attributed to Statham’s family (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>One of the quotes reads: “With heavy hearts, we confirm the unfortunate news regarding Jason. We ask for privacy and respect during this difficult time.”<br><br>However, the statement, which can’t be found in any credible news reports, does not specifically claim Statham died (T0160.002: Information is False). <br><br>The article also includes an image of Statham next to a coffin and the words “rest in peace”, continuing: “As of now, there is no confirmed report on whether this news pertains to a personal tragedy, a serious health issue, or even the shocking possibility of Jason’s passing.”<br><br>There is no record of Statham’s family making the statement attributed to them, nor has there been any significant announcement regarding his health, death or career. <br><br>The same post and article on a different website have been shared by other pages on Facebook, including one called Buzz Network.<br><br>Statham was pictured, alive and apparently well, alongside Albanian-born football star Granit Xhaka in an image shared to Xhaka’s Instagram page and reported by the Albanian Post on July 8, 2025, the same day the Celebrity Cars post appeared. <br><br>Another death hoax that’s been shared widely recently targets British celebrity Simon Cowell, claiming [“SAD NEW : 39 Minutes Ago In Chigaco, “America’s Got Talent” Simon Cowell, He Has Been Confirmed….” (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait)]. <br><br>While the Facebook post doesn’t specifically mention a death, Cowell’s photo is juxtaposed next to a coffin in a composite image that also depicts a crushed, burnt out vehicle (T0165: Edited Content).<br><br>A reverse image search of the damaged car reveals the photo was taken in Texas in 2023 after a head-on collision, as reported by NBC News (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current).<br><br>Cowell’s personal Instagram account has been active in recent days, sharing clips from his TV show’s account, America’s Got Talent.</i> |
