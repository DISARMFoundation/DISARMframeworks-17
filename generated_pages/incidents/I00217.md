| [T0039.001 Collaborating Assets Seed and Ping](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0039.001.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes." Neither "Verified" nor other fact-checking projects were able to find any similar disclaimers for more recent videos.<br><br>There's no trace of any of the videos described above, which appeared in 2022–2023, on the BBC website or on the corporation's social media accounts, and the media group's official representatives have repeatedly been forced to claim that the stories are fabricated. These claims are independently confirmed by fact-checking projects operating in various countries. However, by this point, the fake publications have accumulated millions of views and influenced the opinions of many people about the global situation. <br><br>Who is behind the falsifications?<br><br>Many of the videos described above began spreading on social media shortly after the publication of statements by Russian officials and speakers collaborating with state media containing the same points (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). For example, the narrative about Ukrainian weapons in the hands of Hamas militants emerged on October 7, the day of the group's attack on Israel. This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing. However, sometimes it's enough to simply visit the website or the official BBC News accounts on X , Instagram , YouTube , or TikTok to confirm that such information has not been published there.<br><br>There are also a number of significant differences in the design of fake and real videos, which make it possible to determine whether a video is fabricated or not, even without specialized tools or video content verification skills. <br><br>Firstly, the fake videos feature background music, while the originals rarely use it (if music is present, it's overlaid on the main audio track). The so-called caption videos (videos with embedded subtitles) published by the BBC use the original audio from the footage used in the videos , while the fake videos, on the contrary, lack it.<br><br>Secondly, when a genuine BBC report shows a clip of someone speaking, their voice is not muted. For example, in the fabricated December video about Ukraine selling arms to Hamas, the footage of Eliot Higgins and Shayan Sardarizadeh allegedly making this statement is accompanied only by background music, and the British journalist's lip movements make it clear that he is speaking a completely different phrase than the one in the caption. Footage of Nassim Taleb was used in exactly the same way in a report about the impending US withdrawal from NATO. <br><br>Thirdly, although the disinformation campaigners use elements of the BBC video design (the opening title, the logo, the characteristic vertical red stripe near the title), the font in the fake videos does not match the company's.<br><br>Fourth, native speakers may note that the captions of such fake videos regularly contain spelling, grammar, and stylistic errors that are virtually impossible to find in a reputable media corporation. For example, an October video about a Bellingcat investigation includes the phrase "Ukrainian Defense Prime Minister," while the captions of a video about Nassim Taleb's forecast sometimes lack the necessary articles.<br><br>These recommendations apply to any videos of this kind, regardless of whose logo you see in the frame. And they're worth taking on board, as there's no reason to believe that the current method of fake news stories, which generates millions of views, will become tiresome for disinformation makers anytime soon.</i> |

The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times).

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).

It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project.

The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

| [T0068 Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0068.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

| [T0068 Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0068.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)).

| [T0068 Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0068.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes." Neither "Verified" nor other fact-checking projects were able to find any similar disclaimers for more recent videos.<br><br>There's no trace of any of the videos described above, which appeared in 2022–2023, on the BBC website or on the corporation's social media accounts, and the media group's official representatives have repeatedly been forced to claim that the stories are fabricated. These claims are independently confirmed by fact-checking projects operating in various countries. However, by this point, the fake publications have accumulated millions of views and influenced the opinions of many people about the global situation. <br><br>Who is behind the falsifications?<br><br>Many of the videos described above began spreading on social media shortly after the publication of statements by Russian officials and speakers collaborating with state media containing the same points (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). For example, the narrative about Ukrainian weapons in the hands of Hamas militants emerged on October 7, the day of the group's attack on Israel. This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times).

The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times).

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).

It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

| [T0097.110 Party Official Persona](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0097.110.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion.

| [T0097.110 Party Official Persona](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0097.110.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation.

It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes." Neither "Verified" nor other fact-checking projects were able to find any similar disclaimers for more recent videos.<br><br>There's no trace of any of the videos described above, which appeared in 2022–2023, on the BBC website or on the corporation's social media accounts, and the media group's official representatives have repeatedly been forced to claim that the stories are fabricated. These claims are independently confirmed by fact-checking projects operating in various countries. However, by this point, the fake publications have accumulated millions of views and influenced the opinions of many people about the global situation. <br><br>Who is behind the falsifications?<br><br>Many of the videos described above began spreading on social media shortly after the publication of statements by Russian officials and speakers collaborating with state media containing the same points (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). For example, the narrative about Ukrainian weapons in the hands of Hamas militants emerged on October 7, the day of the group's attack on Israel. This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

| [T0151.001 Social Media Platform](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0151.001.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion.

| [T0152.004 Website Asset](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0152.004.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes."

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).

It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes." Neither "Verified" nor other fact-checking projects were able to find any similar disclaimers for more recent videos.<br><br>There's no trace of any of the videos described above, which appeared in 2022–2023, on the BBC website or on the corporation's social media accounts, and the media group's official representatives have repeatedly been forced to claim that the stories are fabricated. These claims are independently confirmed by fact-checking projects operating in various countries. However, by this point, the fake publications have accumulated millions of views and influenced the opinions of many people about the global situation. <br><br>Who is behind the falsifications?<br><br>Many of the videos described above began spreading on social media shortly after the publication of statements by Russian officials and speakers collaborating with state media containing the same points (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). For example, the narrative about Ukrainian weapons in the hands of Hamas militants emerged on October 7, the day of the group's attack on Israel. This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project.

The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

| [T0160.002 Information is False](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0160.002.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

| [T0160.002 Information is False](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0160.002.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)).

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).

It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes." Neither "Verified" nor other fact-checking projects were able to find any similar disclaimers for more recent videos.<br><br>There's no trace of any of the videos described above, which appeared in 2022–2023, on the BBC website or on the corporation's social media accounts, and the media group's official representatives have repeatedly been forced to claim that the stories are fabricated. These claims are independently confirmed by fact-checking projects operating in various countries. However, by this point, the fake publications have accumulated millions of views and influenced the opinions of many people about the global situation. <br><br>Who is behind the falsifications?<br><br>Many of the videos described above began spreading on social media shortly after the publication of statements by Russian officials and speakers collaborating with state media containing the same points (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). For example, the narrative about Ukrainian weapons in the hands of Hamas militants emerged on October 7, the day of the group's attack on Israel. This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

| [T0160.007 Claim Previously Fact Checked](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0160.007.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

| [T0161.001 Impersonated Content](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0161.001.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)).

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).

"Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes." Neither "Verified" nor other fact-checking projects were able to find any similar disclaimers for more recent videos.<br><br>There's no trace of any of the videos described above, which appeared in 2022–2023, on the BBC website or on the corporation's social media accounts, and the media group's official representatives have repeatedly been forced to claim that the stories are fabricated.

However, by this point, the fake publications have accumulated millions of views and influenced the opinions of many people about the global situation. <br><br>Who is behind the falsifications?<br><br>Many of the videos described above began spreading on social media shortly after the publication of statements by Russian officials and speakers collaborating with state media containing the same points (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).

This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times).

It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project.

Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

| [T0161.002 Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0161.002.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).

"Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes." Neither "Verified" nor other fact-checking projects were able to find any similar disclaimers for more recent videos.<br><br>There's no trace of any of the videos described above, which appeared in 2022–2023, on the BBC website or on the corporation's social media accounts, and the media group's official representatives have repeatedly been forced to claim that the stories are fabricated.

However, by this point, the fake publications have accumulated millions of views and influenced the opinions of many people about the global situation. <br><br>Who is behind the falsifications?<br><br>Many of the videos described above began spreading on social media shortly after the publication of statements by Russian officials and speakers collaborating with state media containing the same points (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).

This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

| [T0162 Reframe Context](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0162.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)).

It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation.

This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times).

Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

| [T0162.003 Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0162.003.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)).

"Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes." Neither "Verified" nor other fact-checking projects were able to find any similar disclaimers for more recent videos.<br><br>There's no trace of any of the videos described above, which appeared in 2022–2023, on the BBC website or on the corporation's social media accounts, and the media group's official representatives have repeatedly been forced to claim that the stories are fabricated. These claims are independently confirmed by fact-checking projects operating in various countries. However, by this point, the fake publications have accumulated millions of views and influenced the opinions of many people about the global situation. <br><br>Who is behind the falsifications?<br><br>Many of the videos described above began spreading on social media shortly after the publication of statements by Russian officials and speakers collaborating with state media containing the same points (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).

This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation.

It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets.

The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music.

Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists.

"Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists.

"Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).

"Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes." Neither "Verified" nor other fact-checking projects were able to find any similar disclaimers for more recent videos.<br><br>There's no trace of any of the videos described above, which appeared in 2022–2023, on the BBC website or on the corporation's social media accounts, and the media group's official representatives have repeatedly been forced to claim that the stories are fabricated. These claims are independently confirmed by fact-checking projects operating in various countries. However, by this point, the fake publications have accumulated millions of views and influenced the opinions of many people about the global situation. <br><br>Who is behind the falsifications?<br><br>Many of the videos described above began spreading on social media shortly after the publication of statements by Russian officials and speakers collaborating with state media containing the same points (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). For example, the narrative about Ukrainian weapons in the hands of Hamas militants emerged on October 7, the day of the group's attack on Israel. This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project.

The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

| [T0166 AI-Generated Content](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0166.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion.

The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022.

| [T0166 AI-Generated Content](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0166.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes."

It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code.

The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation.

This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing.

The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times).

It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified).

The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023.

The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes." Neither "Verified" nor other fact-checking projects were able to find any similar disclaimers for more recent videos.<br><br>There's no trace of any of the videos described above, which appeared in 2022–2023, on the BBC website or on the corporation's social media accounts, and the media group's official representatives have repeatedly been forced to claim that the stories are fabricated. These claims are independently confirmed by fact-checking projects operating in various countries. However, by this point, the fake publications have accumulated millions of views and influenced the opinions of many people about the global situation. <br><br>Who is behind the falsifications?<br><br>Many of the videos described above began spreading on social media shortly after the publication of statements by Russian officials and speakers collaborating with state media containing the same points (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). For example, the narrative about Ukrainian weapons in the hands of Hamas militants emerged on October 7, the day of the group's attack on Israel. This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing. However, sometimes it's enough to simply visit the website or the official BBC News accounts on X , Instagram , YouTube , or TikTok to confirm that such information has not been published there.<br><br>There are also a number of significant differences in the design of fake and real videos, which make it possible to determine whether a video is fabricated or not, even without specialized tools or video content verification skills. <br><br>Firstly, the fake videos feature background music, while the originals rarely use it (if music is present, it's overlaid on the main audio track). The so-called caption videos (videos with embedded subtitles) published by the BBC use the original audio from the footage used in the videos , while the fake videos, on the contrary, lack it.<br><br>Secondly, when a genuine BBC report shows a clip of someone speaking, their voice is not muted. For example, in the fabricated December video about Ukraine selling arms to Hamas, the footage of Eliot Higgins and Shayan Sardarizadeh allegedly making this statement is accompanied only by background music, and the British journalist's lip movements make it clear that he is speaking a completely different phrase than the one in the caption. Footage of Nassim Taleb was used in exactly the same way in a report about the impending US withdrawal from NATO. <br><br>Thirdly, although the disinformation campaigners use elements of the BBC video design (the opening title, the logo, the characteristic vertical red stripe near the title), the font in the fake videos does not match the company's.<br><br>Fourth, native speakers may note that the captions of such fake videos regularly contain spelling, grammar, and stylistic errors that are virtually impossible to find in a reputable media corporation. For example, an October video about a Bellingcat investigation includes the phrase "Ukrainian Defense Prime Minister," while the captions of a video about Nassim Taleb's forecast sometimes lack the necessary articles.<br><br>These recommendations apply to any videos of this kind, regardless of whose logo you see in the frame. And they're worth taking on board, as there's no reason to believe that the current method of fake news stories, which generates millions of views, will become tiresome for disinformation makers anytime soon.</i> |
