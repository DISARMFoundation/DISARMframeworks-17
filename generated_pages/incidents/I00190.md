| [T0161.002 Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0161.002.md) | <i>On 24 August 2015, the web site Business Standard News published a fake news article reporting that New Jersey governor (and Republican presidential hopeful) Chris Christie said that teachers were overpaid and should make minimum wage plus a bonus based on the number of students who pass standardized tests (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution):<br><br>“"Teachers are paid too much, that’s what’s bankrupting the system,” Christie said. “Some teachers make six-figure salaries and that’s not including retirement benefits.”<br><br>“Christie suggested a new teacher pay structure. He proposed teachers get paid minimum wage and a bonus for every student that passes standardized tests.<br><br>““Teacher pay should be determined by how well their students are doing,” Christie said. “They need to be held accountable. If students are failing, teachers are nothing more than glorified baby sitters.””<br><br>The above-quoted story is a work of fiction from a satirical (i.e., fake news) site (T0160.005: Content Produced as Satire). A disclaimer on the Business Standard News (aka "B.S. News") site states that it was designed to "parody" real news (T0143.004: Parody Persona, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona):<br><br>“The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle. The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true.”<br><br>The Business Standard News has previously published fake stories about Fox News' hiring Stacey Dash to "attract old white dudes" and George Zimmerman's being engaged as a Fox News contributor.</i> |
