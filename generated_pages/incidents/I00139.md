# Incident I00139: 2021 video of tractor rally to support farmers' protests falsely linked to wrestler's protest

* **Summary:** <i>Indian wrestlers have been protesting since April 2023 protesting lack of action against Wrestling Federation of India President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over accusations of sexual harassment by female wrestlers. Demanding that Singh be arrested, the wrestlers have asked for support from farmers, and other groups. Amid these events, some old misleading videos and images have been associated with the ongoing protests. One such video on Twitter showing tractors with Indian flags was shared as part of the wrestlers' ongoing protest. The post's caption read: "Walk to Delhi with a tractor to get justice for your daughters," and tagged women wrestlers Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat. This post received over 4,000 views. Another Twitter user shared the video, claiming it showed the farmers joining the wrestlers' protest. The video was also shared by the Delhi Pradesh Youth Congress' official Facebook account.<br><br>Although farmers have joined the wrestler's protest in Delhi's Jantar Mantar, the viral video showing tractors with Indian flags is not recent and is unrelated to the current demonstrations against sexual harassment.</i>

Demanding that Singh be arrested, the wrestlers have asked for support from farmers, and other groups. Amid these events, some old misleading videos and images have been associated with the ongoing protests. One such video on Twitter showing tractors with Indian flags was shared as part of the wrestlers' ongoing protest. The post's caption read: "Walk to Delhi with a tractor to get justice for your daughters," and tagged women wrestlers Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat. This post received over 4,000 views. Another Twitter user shared the video, claiming it showed the farmers joining the wrestlers' protest. The video was also shared by the Delhi Pradesh Youth Congress' official Facebook account.<br><br>Although farmers have joined the wrestler's protest in Delhi's Jantar Mantar, the viral video showing tractors with Indian flags is not recent (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current) and is unrelated to the current demonstrations against sexual harassment (T0162: Reframe Context, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>We noted that the viral video, which apparently showed a tractor march in support of the wrestlers' protest, had a Manorama News Channel logo. However, the channel did not broadcast such footage of the tractor march during the wrestlers' protests.<br><br>After further examination, we found that a YouTube video by Manorama News contained the same visuals as the viral video between timestamps 0:46 and 1:45 (T0165.001: Clipped Content). However, the viral video had been edited to increase the playback speed (T0165.003: Playback Speed Altered) and had a different audio track (T0162.002: Edits Made to News Report which Reframe Context). The English translation of the Malayalam description on the YouTube video stated, "Solidarity with Farmers' Struggle; Kisan March led by Shafi Parambil," dated 2021. The rally was clearly held in support of the farmers’ protest in Delhi against the three farm laws.</i> |
