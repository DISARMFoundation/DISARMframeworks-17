# Incident I00186: Fact check: No evidence of miscarriage surge since vaccine rollout

* **Summary:** <i>"Miscarriages skyrocket 350% in six weeks due to k*vid vacsines (sic)," writes one Facebook user in a March 29 post.<br><br>[...]<br><br>We rate this claim MISSING CONTEXT because without additional context it might be misleading. Claims of miscarriages increasing by 366% over a six-week period originate from a U.K.-based alternative media site, The Daily Expose, citing data from the U.K.'s regulatory body, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. While the total counts of miscarriages are accurate, The Daily Expose article fails to take into account the increased number of women being vaccinated over the six-week time period (from December 2020 to March) alongside the expected frequency of miscarriages in the general population, which is around 26%. The MHRA has stated there is no cause-and-effect association between COVID-19 vaccinations and the incidence of miscarriage.</i>
