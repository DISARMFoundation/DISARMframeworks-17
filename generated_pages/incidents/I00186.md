# Incident I00186: Fact check: No evidence of miscarriage surge since vaccine rollout

* **Summary:** <i>"Miscarriages skyrocket 350% in six weeks due to k*vid vacsines (sic)," writes one Facebook user in a March 29 post.<br><br>[...]<br><br>We rate this claim MISSING CONTEXT because without additional context it might be misleading. Claims of miscarriages increasing by 366% over a six-week period originate from a U.K.-based alternative media site, The Daily Expose, citing data from the U.K.'s regulatory body, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. While the total counts of miscarriages are accurate, The Daily Expose article fails to take into account the increased number of women being vaccinated over the six-week time period (from December 2020 to March) alongside the expected frequency of miscarriages in the general population, which is around 26%. The MHRA has stated there is no cause-and-effect association between COVID-19 vaccinations and the incidence of miscarriage.</i>

At least half of these would be expected to be women, so the number of women of child-bearing age (taking the vaccine) is estimated to have increased from 665,424 to 2,146,866 for the same time frame," the MHRA said. <br><br>It is estimated that as many as 26% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, with nearly 80% of early miscarriages occurring in the first 12 weeks, or first trimester, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.<br><br>Given this, the MHRA acknowledged "some miscarriages would be expected to occur following vaccination purely by chance." <br><br>The Daily Expose article also claims two separate incidences of a premature birth and a stillbirth following vaccination. The MHRA explained that in the U.K., around 8 in 100 births are premature, so some would be expected to happen after vaccination also "purely by chance."  <br><br>The MHRA, however, disputed the claim of the stillbirth, telling Reuters some events can be incorrectly reported.

The MHRA has stated there is no cause-and-effect association between COVID-19 vaccinations and the incidence of miscarriage. </i> |
