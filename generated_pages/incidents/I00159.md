| [T0162.008 Context Reframed by Edits to Media](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0162.008.md) | <i>Several posts on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook have shared an approximately 40-second clip of a speech by former U.S. President Barack Obama. In the clip, he states, "You just have to flood a country’s public square with enough raw sewage. You just have to raise enough questions, spread enough dirt, and plant enough conspiracy theorizing that citizens no longer know what to believe. Once they lose trust in their leaders, in mainstream media, in political institutions, in each other, in the possibility of truth, the game’s won."<br><br>The captions accompanying these posts quote parts of his speech, with some labeling Obama as a villain and insinuating that he advocates for using conspiracy theories to manipulate people through disinformation.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The clips of Obama’s speech, however, have been taken out of context, creating the false impression that he is endorsing disinformation. In reality, Obama was addressing how authoritarian leaders worldwide utilize disinformation as a weapon against democratic nations (T0162.009: Statement Reframed by Removal from Context, T0162.008: Context Reframed by Edits to Media).<br><br>A keyword search revealed that the clip was extracted from Obama's keynote address at Stanford University on April 21, 2022. The address focused on the dangers of disinformation to democracy.<br><br>Following this lead, we found the full speech on Youtube, uploaded by multiple channels. The relevant clip appears between 31:38 and 32:16 in the video (T0165.001: Clipped Content).</i> |
