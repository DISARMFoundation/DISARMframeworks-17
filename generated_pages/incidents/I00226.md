| [T0160.002 Information is False](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0160.002.md) | <i>CLAIM: A California bill would allow mothers to kill their babies up to seven days after birth.<br><br>AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. A bill in the California legislature, AB 2223, is being falsely represented. It was introduced to provide legal protection to women who lose their child due to pregnancy complications, and those who have abortions. It does not legalize the killing of infants (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>THE FACTS: Social media users are sharing a headline that falsely suggests a proposed California bill will legalize “infanticide,” the killing of an infant (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>“California introduces new bill that would allow mothers to kill their babies up to 7 days after birth,” reads the erroneous headline on a story published on the Miami Standard, a conservative website.<br><br>“To everyone saying it’s fake because it was posted on 4/1 just do some research. 99% of y’all don’t stay in Cali. It’s called The infanticide bill,” claimed a Facebook post sharing a screenshot of the headline on April 1 with over 11,000 reshares.<br><br>But the posts misrepresent the purpose of the bill and its potential impact. The bill eliminates a requirement that a coroner must investigate deaths related to suspected self-induced or criminal abortion. Coroner statements on certificates for a fetal death could not be used to pursue a criminal case against the mother.<br><br>The aim of the bill, introduced Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, a Democrat representing the East Bay, is to protect women who end a pregnancy or have a miscarriage from being investigated, persecuted or incarcerated. Erin Ivie, a spokesperson for Wicks told The Associated Press in an email. “The bill is specific to pregnancy and pregnancy-related outcomes, and does not decriminalize the ‘murder of babies’ in the weeks after birth,” Ivie said.<br><br>Social media users making the false claim cite a line in the bill stating that a person would not have criminal liability in the event of “perinatal death,” a period of time following a birth.<br><br>The section of the bill states: “Notwithstanding any other law, a person shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability or penalty, or otherwise deprived of their rights, based on their actions or omissions with respect to their pregnancy or actual, potential, or alleged pregnancy outcome, including miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion, or perinatal death.”<br><br>The bill does not establish a time frame around “perinatal.” The Miami Standard article defines the period as “up to seven days or more.” The outlet wrote in a response to the AP that, “Perinatal is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as at or around the time of birth. This could extend up to 28 days after the infant has been born.” The outlet included statements by several attorneys from pro-life organizations and firms arguing that the wording could decriminalize killing infants.<br><br>But the term “perinatal death” in the bill is intended to mean the death of an infant caused by complications in pregnancy, according to Ivie. To clarify the term, Wicks added a new amendment to the bill on Monday to change the wording to, “perinatal death due to a pregnancy-related cause.”<br><br>Even without the new amendment, the bill wouldn’t have allowed for “infanticide” or a murder of an infant days after it’s born, since homicide is illegal, according to Farah Diaz-Tello, senior counsel and legal director at If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice.<br><br>Before the bill was introduced, a “legal alert” was issued earlier this year by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, which clarified criminal liability around the death of a fetus, saying prosecutors should not charge women with murder when a fetus dies, even if their behavior may have contributed to the death. He issued the advisory after San Joaquin Valley’s Kings County charged two women, Chelsea Becker and Adora Perez, with “fetal murder,” alleging their drug use led to stillbirths. Becker’s case has been dismissed, and Perez’s conviction was cleared, although her case is ongoing.<br><br>Diaz-Tello says Wicks’ bill could have ensured legal protections for these women from the outset.<br><br>Outside of the two cases, another example where the bill might apply would be a pregnant woman who exhibited signs of preterm labor, but could not afford to be on bed rest, Ivie said. While there could be a chance that the delivery results in a stillborn, the bill would ensure the woman couldn’t be prosecuted if that did occur, Ivie explained.<br><br>“Anti-abortion activists are peddling an absurd and disingenuous argument that this bill is about killing newborns when ironically, the part of the bill they’re pointing to is about protecting and supporting parents experiencing the grief of pregnancy loss,” Wicks said in an email to the AP.<br><br>On Tuesday, the bill passed through the Assembly Judiciary committee with the new amendment and is moving to the health committee hearings.</i> |
