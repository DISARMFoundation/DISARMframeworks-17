| [T0166 AI-Generated Content](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0166.md) | <i>A video shared online purporting to show a teacher in a headscarf instructing white children to bow and chant “Allahu Akbar” has probably been created using AI (T0166: AI-Generated Content), according to two AI forensics analysts who reviewed the footage for Reuters.<br><br>The 15-second clip, shared widely on social media on November 7 as if authentic, mimics CCTV footage and has a timestamp of 10:24 on November 6, 2025. It shows around a dozen uniformed pupils kneeling on prayer mats in a classroom, led by a woman, apparently a teacher, who has a British accent and is wearing a headscarf.<br><br>The children raise their hands and repeat “Allahu Akbar” (“God is Great” in Arabic) after the teacher, who then stands up and lowers herself as if sitting down, tells the children to repeat: “Subhan Allah al-A'la” (“Glory be to God the Most High” in Arabic).<br><br>One X post with 1.8 million views captioned the clip: “Young, white children are being indoctrinated into Islam. They raise their hands in the air and chant Allah Akbar. This has to stop” (T0162.006: AI-Generated Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality), while another X post viewed 1.1 million times said: “This is sick. This is the Muslim indoctrination” (T0162.006: AI-Generated Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality).<br><br>However, the two AI analysts told Reuters that visual inconsistencies that would not occur in a genuine video implied it had been created using AI (T0166: AI-Generated Content).<br><br>Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor at the University at Buffalo, United States, said via email the clip “exhibits multiple signs of AI generation”.<br><br>He said visual anomalies included the teacher sitting on an invisible chair and her face appearing distorted, the heads of students in the front row stretching unnaturally, wall decorations and texts changing over the course of the video, and a girl’s twin braids appearing and disappearing.<br><br>Rob Cover, a professor of digital communication at RMIT University in Australia, said in an email to Reuters that the clip “is very likely to have been AI-generated”.<br><br>In terms of the audio, he pointed to “metallic sounding” voices that, he said, are common for lower-quality AI-generated content and, visually, to the bodies, heads, and hair of the children being less in focus compared to their nearby surroundings.<br><br>Cover noted unusual movement in wall posters, inconsistencies in the hair tie of the girl in the front row on the far left and that the “most obvious indicator” was a missing chair when the teacher appears seated.</i> |
