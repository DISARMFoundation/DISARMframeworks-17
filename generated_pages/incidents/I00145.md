| [T0161.002 Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0161.002.md) | <i>Social media posts claiming Elon Musk has agreed to buy the US news channel CNN for $3 billion are not true and originate from a satirical article (T0160.005: Content Produced as Satire).<br><br>A number of posts on Facebook and Threads have been shared with the caption: "Elon Musk Agrees to $3 Billion to Buy CNN. Elon Musk Reportedly Eyeing CNN Acquisition: ‘I’ll Fix the Media, One Network at a Time’” (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution, T0162.011: Content Originally Produced as Satire Presented as Not Satire). The claim has also spread to X, which Mr Musk owns. <br><br>But the claim actually stems from a satirical article (T0160.005: Content Produced as Satire) published by a parody news website called SpaceXMania, dated 18 October 2024 (T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0143.004: Parody Persona). The headline “Elon Musk Reportedly Eyeing CNN Acquisition: ‘I’ll Fix the Media, One Network at a Time’” is similar to many of the social media posts. However the article is clearly labelled as satire, and the website’s ‘about page’ also says it provides the “freshest fake news, some sassy analysis, and a good dose of satire” focused on Mr Musk. <br><br>CNN also told Full Fact: “There is no truth in rumours of a sale or change in ownership of CNN whatsoever. Any statements to the contrary are completely false.” <br><br>Likewise Mr Musk has not issued any statement about purchasing CNN and there is no evidence from credible news outlets that any such arrangement is on the cards. Full Fact has also contacted Mr Musk about the claim, and will update this article if we receive a response. <br><br>Although some claims may seem obviously false, we may still fact check them because it may not be clear to everyone, particularly more casual internet users, that they are untrue. </i> |
