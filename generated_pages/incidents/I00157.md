| [T0162.008 Context Reframed by Edits to Media](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0162.008.md) | <i>Social media users have shared a video claiming that Tejashwi Yadav, Bihar politician and chairman of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), was inebriated during a media address. The 43-second video, circulated on X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube, shows Yadav speaking slowly and appearing to slur his words while addressing reporters.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Using the logo in the viral clip and Hindi keywords from Yadav’s statement, we located the original video on the Indian news outlet Republic Bharat’s YouTube channel. Uploaded on June 11, 2024, under the title "What did Tejashwi Yadav say when taking a dig at the division of ministries (translated from Hindi)?”, the video is only 30 seconds long and does not show Yadav slurring or speaking slowly.<br><br>When we slowed down the playback speed of this video to 0.75x, we observed that it matched the slurred and slowed effect seen in the now-viral videos. Additionally, the edited video length matches the 43-second duration of the circulated clips. A comparison reveals that social media users utilized an edited, slowed-down version of the video to propagate a false claim (T0162.008: Context Reframed by Edits to Media, T0165.003: Playback Speed Altered).<br><br>[...]<br><br>A user on X shared the clip with the caption, “Tejasvi Yadav, Ex-Deputy CM- Bihar. Drunk. & (sic) Bihar is Dry State (No Alcohol). Jhum Barabar Jhum (keep on dancing)”.</i> |
