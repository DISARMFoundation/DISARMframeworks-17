| [T0160.002 Information is False](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0160.002.md) | <i>Claim: Television host Kim Atienza, popularly known as Kuya Kim, died on Monday, June 3, 2024. <br><br>Rating: False (T0160.002: Information is False)<br><br>Why we fact-checked this: The TikTok video bearing the claim has gained 1,615 likes, 697 favorites, and over 208,300 views, as of writing. <br><br>“Hanggang sa muli Kuya Kim #viral #fyp #sad #death,” the caption reads. <br><br>The post includes a black-and-white photo of Atienza, the GMA Integrated News logo, and a message expressing gratitude to Atienza. The visual design of the post resembles the social media cards used by GMA News to announce someone’s passing (T0161.001: Impersonated Content).<br><br>The Facts: Atienza refuted these claims, stating that the posts about his death were a hoax.<br><br>“Aabot din tayo diyan, but not today,” Atienza said in a Facebook post on Monday, June 3.  (We will get there, but not today.)<br><br>The next day, June 4, Atienza even appeared in the GMA news program 24 Oras to host his segment “Kuya Kim, Ano Na?”<br><br>Fake account: The false claim was made by the TikTok account “gmanewsbalita_156.” This is not an official account of GMA News. The news outlet’s official account on TikTok has three million followers and 103.8 million likes.<br><br>Debunked: In 2020, Rappler also fact-checked some posts claiming that Atienza was in critical condition after supposedly being shot by robbers in his home.</i> |
