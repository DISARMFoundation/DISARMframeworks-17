However, the footage predates recent conflict in October 2023 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current) and the subtitles do not translate what the politicians actually said (T0162.001: Incorrect Subtitled Speech Reframes Context, T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>[...]<br><br>One video shows President Putin supposedly saying: “America wants to destroy Israel. As we destroy Ukraine in past. I am warning America. Russia will help Palestine and America can do nothing [sic].”<br><br>[...]<br><br>A USA Today logo is visible in the top corner of some versions of the videos but the subtitles are not in the media company’s traditional colours or style (T0162.002: Edits Made to News Report which Reframe Context). Some versions of the video feature a flashing red dot to give the impression it was recorded live.<br><br>Thousands of people have also viewed a video of President Erdogan appearing to say: “I am warning America don’t in Israel Palestine war. We are with our innocent Palestinian brother’s. We are ready to defend Palestine at any price [sic].”<br><br>[...]<br><br>The videos both use old footage of the politicians which predate current events in the Middle East, and show mistranslated subtitles. <br><br>The clip of President Putin actually shows him during a meeting with the country’s ‘Council for Civil Society and Human Rights’ in December 2022, and there’s no mention of Israel or Palestine in the subtitles from USA Today or in the transcript for the whole meeting released by the Kremlin. Media reports from the time don’t mention him saying this either.<br><br>The video of President Erdogan was published by news website Middle East Eye in July 2023 with the publication’s logo appearing in the clip on social media (T0162.002: Edits Made to News Report which Reframe Context, T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current, T0162.001: Incorrect Subtitled Speech Reframes Context, T0160.002: Information is False). While he is speaking in Turkish about relations with Israel and “the Palestinian state”, the subtitles show there is no reference to America. </i> |
