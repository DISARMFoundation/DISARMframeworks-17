# Incident I00135: Hamas Attacks, Israel Bombs Gaza and Misinformation Surges Online

* **Summary:** <i>Misinformation has been spreading rapidly online ever since Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7. At least 1,000 people were killed and the Islamist militant group took between 100 and 150 hostages. Israel retaliated, threatening a complete siege of Gaza and hitting the area with multiple airstrikes, killing more than 900 people. <br><br>Alongside credible reports on the unfolding conflict, misinformation about incidents attributed to both sides have been widely circulated online. With the overwhelming amount of social media content on the conflict, it can be difficult to parse out verified information from posts that have been reused or manipulated.<br><br>In recent days, viral social media posts have presented years-old footage, or footage from entirely different conflict zones, as depicting the latest Israeli bombing of Gaza. They have baselessly claimed that a video of a lost girl in an Arabic-speaking country is an Israeli hostage in Gaza and have presented flares lit by Algerian football fans as the lights and explosions of a warzone. These are but a few examples.</i>

At least 1,000 people were killed and the Islamist militant group took between 100 and 150 hostages. Israel retaliated, threatening a complete siege of Gaza and hitting the area with multiple airstrikes, killing more than 900 people. <br><br>[...]<br><br>During breaking news events, there is often uncertainty about the claims we see on social media. As we discuss in our 2021 guide, determining when a video was filmed is an essential part of debunking dis- and misinformation. <br><br>We have identified multiple examples of footage being reused from past conflicts and military events as evidence of current events in Israel-Palestine.  <br><br>[...]<br><br>On the morning of October 9, the X account of pro-government Syrian newspaper Al-Watan (T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0143.001: Authentic Persona) published footage of explosions in a cityscape with the words ‘scenes of the Israeli bombing of Gaza city’ in Arabic (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). Avichay Adraee, IDF Spokesperson for the Arab Media (T0097.110: Party Official Persona, T0143.001: Authentic Persona), posted a composite of three pieces of footage, the first of which also depicted this scene (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>Al-Watan has since deleted their tweet. At the time of writing, Adraee’s tweet is still available.<br><br>This footage was neither filmed in 2023 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current) nor was it filmed in Palestine (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location).<br><br>When zooming in on the video, we noticed the distinctive shape of this schoolyard with a basketball court, highlighted in both images below in blue. It could easily be matched to satellite imagery of Ariha, a town in the Idlib Governorate of northern Syria (35.810781, 36.614178).<br><br>[...]<br><br>AirWars, an independent project to catalogue civilian harm caused by bombing campaigns in the Middle East, also investigated this incident. The website’s database entry incident R2349 details a June 2021 attack on the city of Ariha which includes additional information about this incident. AirWars shared a collage of imagery of the attack; the bottom left photo matches the footage shared earlier. </i> |

Israel retaliated, threatening a complete siege of Gaza and hitting the area with multiple airstrikes, killing more than 900 people. <br><br>[...]<br><br>Misinformation can also be spread using imagery that doesn’t show conflict or violence. There are numerous examples of videos being decontextualised from their original source to appear relevant to the current Israel-Hamas attacks (T0162: Reframe Context). <br><br>For example, there is a video that depicts multiple paragliders with a sunset in the background. There are some palm trees and a building shown in the video. Accounts are claiming these are Hamas soldiers paragliding into Israel.<br><br>However, this video does not take place in Israel. Reuters was able to geolocate this video to Egypt. The building shown in the video is a military academy and can be found at (30.108686, 31.358481), in Cairo’s El Nozha district (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location).<br><br>We were able to locate an older version of this video shared on TikTok on 24 September 2023 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current). The coat of arms of this institution can be seen in the foreground of this original footage — though in the misleading TikTok video claiming it was filmed in Israel, this detail are obscured by the caption in red, while the entire building has been cropped out from the version shared on X (T0162.008: Context Reframed by Edits to Media, T0165.002: Cropped Content).</i> |

While the video shows military activity, it does not show its impact or target.<br><br>[Here, Bellingcat provides a collection of three screenshots, two showing posts made to TikTok (T0151.008: Microblogging Platform), the first captioned “BREAKING NEWS Hamas just Fired hundreds of rockets towards israel iron dome stopped working #IsraelPalestineWar” (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), the second captioned “Israel under attack… #israel #hamas #usa🇺🇸 #nowar #warzone”. The third screenshot is a post made to X by a verified account controlled by the leader of Britain First, a political party and hate group (T0146.003: Verified Account Asset, T0097.110: Party Official Persona, T0143.001: Authentic Persona). The post contains the video with the text “Rockets being fired at the Israel capital Tel Aviv”]<br><br>However, the video is at least three years old, as it was uploaded to YouTube in February 2020 by a Russian-speaking account whose name translates as ‘World on the Brink.’ </i> |
