| [T0146 Account Asset](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0146.md) | <i>The Czech prime minister’s account on the social media platform X was hacked on Tuesday, with a series of false messages posted, including those claiming a Russian attack on Czech soldiers and a response to U.S. tariffs (T0146: Account Asset, T0097.111: Government Official Persona,  T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0145.005: Compromised Persona, T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>Petr Fiala confirmed the incident, saying the hack originated “from abroad.”<br><br>“Despite thorough security measures, including two-factor authentication … the attackers managed to penetrate the profiles and publish fake posts,” he said. “We are actively cooperating with the police to investigate this incident and identify the perpetrators.”<br><br>One of the posts alleged that Russian forces had attacked Czech military units near the border of Kaliningrad, a heavily militarized Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania. The post was later deleted.<br><br>"The post about the attack on Czech soldiers is not true," government spokesperson Lucie Michut Jesatkova told local media.<br><br>The prime minister’s X account, which has more than 366,000 followers, also briefly displayed a post about preparing sanctions in response to U.S. tariffs. According to local reports, both fake posts included a live video link, which turned out to be a static image with no audio.<br><br>Similar fake content appeared on the X account of Spolu, a center-right political alliance that includes Fiala’s Civic Democratic Party (ODS) (T0146: Account Asset, T0097.111: Government Official Persona,  T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0145.005: Compromised Persona, T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>“We reacted immediately and are working with experts to analyze the attack. High security of our channels is a priority for us,” said ODS spokesperson Jakub Skyva.<br><br>Petr Letocha, a member of the Czech parliament’s security committee, told local media that the breach may have involved someone with administrative access to both accounts.<br><br>“Given that the [prime minister's] account is fully under control again, I believe the attacker no longer has access to it,” he said, adding that two-factor authentication makes such breaches difficult and the investigation may clarify how it was bypassed.<br><br>Czech police confirmed they are investigating the breach to determine how it occurred and whether the false information posted could constitute a criminal offense.</i> |
