| [T0166.001 Deepfake Impersonation](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0166.001.md) | <i>An audio clip posted to social media on Sunday, purporting to show Britain’s opposition leader Keir Starmer verbally abusing his staff, has been debunked as being AI-generated by private-sector and British government analysis (T0166.001: Deepfake Impersonation, T0097.110: Party Official Persona).<br><br>The audio of Keir Starmer was posted on X (formerly Twitter) by a pseudonymous account on Sunday morning, the opening day of the Labour Party conference in Liverpool. The account asserted that the clip, which has now been viewed more than 1.4 million times, was genuine, and that its authenticity had been corroborated by a sound engineer (T0162.006: AI-Generated Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality).<br><br>Ben Colman, the co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender — a deepfake detection business — disputed this assessment when contacted by Recorded Future News: “We found the audio to be 75% likely manipulated based on a copy of a copy that's been going around (a transcoding) (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>[...]<br><br>“It is also our opinion that the creator of this file added background noise to attempt evasion of detection, but our system accounts for this as well,” he said.</i> |
