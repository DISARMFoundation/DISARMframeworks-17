But the AHA says there are potential errors in the research, which has not been peer reviewed (T0163.004: Narrative Cites Academic Research not Peer Reviewed), and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an expert raised questions about its conclusion and methodology.<br><br>"Mrna COVID Vaccines Dramatically Increase Endothelial Inflammatory Markers and ACS Risk as Measured by the PULS Cardiac Test: a Warning," says the title of the abstract, which was published on November 8, 2021 on the website of the AHA journal Circulation.<br><br>The summary -- known as an abstract -- of the research by heart surgeon Steven Gundry says there is an increased five-year risk of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in patients, from 11 percent pre-vaccination to 25 percent after vaccination.<br><br>The abstract has been cited in multiple online articles raising concerns about the shots, and has also circulated on social media.<br><br>The research focuses on mRNA shots, which use technology that differs from traditional vaccines, and have been the subject of a number of inaccurate claims debunked by AFP Fact Check.<br><br>Shortly after the publication of the abstract, the AHA issued an expression of concern about the research by Gundry, who declined through a spokeswoman to comment on the issue.<br><br>"Soon after publication of the above abstract in Circulation, it was brought to the American Heart Association Committee on Scientific Sessions Program's attention that there are potential errors in the abstract," the AHA said.<br><br>"Specifically, there are several typographical errors, there is no data in the abstract regarding myocardial T-cell infiltration, there are no statistical analyses for significance provided, and the author is not clear that only anecdotal data was used," it added.<br><br>Michelle Kirkwood, the AHA's media relations director, told AFP that abstracts are not peer reviewed, meaning they have not been assessed by other scientists prior to publication.</i> |
