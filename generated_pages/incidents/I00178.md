# Incident I00178: Research summary misleadingly cited as evidence Covid-19 shots are dangerous

* **Summary:** <i>A preliminary summary of research in an American Heart Association (AHA) journal claiming that common Covid-19 vaccines more than double the risk of heart problems is being cited as evidence the shots are dangerous. But the AHA says there are potential errors in the research, which has not been peer reviewed, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an expert raised questions about its conclusion and methodology.</i>
