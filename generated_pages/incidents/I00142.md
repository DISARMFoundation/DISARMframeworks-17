| [T0097.110 Party Official Persona](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0097.110.md) | <i>Posts shared on social media, including by Greek politician and economist Yanis Varoufakis (T0097.110: Party Official Persona, T0143.001: Authentic Persona), include a screenshot of a post on X (formerly Twitter) which is captioned: “BREAKING: Bono and Bob Geldof stage two-man vigil outside the Israeli Embassy in Dublin.” (T0162.006: AI-Generated Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality, T0162.011: Content Originally Produced as Satire Presented as Not Satire)<br><br>The bio for the X account which appears to have originally posted the image on 16 December describes itself as offering “fake news and topical satire” (T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0143.004: Parody Persona). A post on 18 December from the same account confirmed the image was “fake”.<br><br>The person behind the account also told fact checkers at Ireland’s The Journal that “the image was created by Grok AI and the tweet is satire”. (T0166: AI-Generated Content, T0160.005: Content Produced as Satire)<br><br>[...]<br><br>There are several other clues suggesting the picture has been generated by AI. The Israeli flag Mr Geldof is holding is wrong. It should have a white background with two horizontal blue stripes and a central Star of David—but in the picture, it has two additional vertical blue stripes. <br><br>The fingers on Mr Geldof’s right hand are also slightly distorted. As we have written before, AI image generators often have particular difficulty replicating fingers.<br><br>In addition to this, there is no evidence that the singers staged a vigil outside the Israeli embassy in Dublin. <br><br>This week Israel announced it will close its embassy in Dublin over "the extreme anti-Israel policies of the Irish government". But there are no credible media reports that Bono or Mr Geldof have staged any such vigil at the embassy. </i> |
