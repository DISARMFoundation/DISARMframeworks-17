# Incident I00223: "Matriochka", la nouvelle campagne de désinformation anti-ukrainienne à destination des médias occidentaux

* **Summary:** <i>[Translated from original in French] As Ukraine faces a Russian invasion that has lasted nearly two years, pro-Russian propaganda continues to flood social media and European countries, notably with the aim of undermining Western support for Kyiv. Since September, online disinformation attributed to Russia has gone beyond simply relaying anti-Ukrainian fake news; it has also begun directly challenging Western media outlets to fact-check certain claims, as shown by data from the "Antibot4Navalny" collective analyzed by AFP. Experts warn that this constitutes a vast "diversionary campaign" targeting journalists. </i>
