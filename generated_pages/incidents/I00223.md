# Incident I00223: "Matriochka", la nouvelle campagne de désinformation anti-ukrainienne à destination des médias occidentaux

* **Summary:** <i>[Translated from original in French] As Ukraine faces a Russian invasion that has lasted nearly two years, pro-Russian propaganda continues to flood social media and European countries, notably with the aim of undermining Western support for Kyiv. Since September, online disinformation attributed to Russia has gone beyond simply relaying anti-Ukrainian fake news; it has also begun directly challenging Western media outlets to fact-check certain claims, as shown by data from the "Antibot4Navalny" collective analyzed by AFP. Experts warn that this constitutes a vast "diversionary campaign" targeting journalists. </i>

The official media don't talk about it, what am I supposed to believe?" she asks.<br><br>Within a few hours, this profile attracted the attention of dozens of French media outlets such as Le Progrès, Paris Match, Mediapart, Le Point, Franceinfo, Le Figaro, RFI, Le Parisien...<br><br>The account then remained inactive until December 20: it then posted a graffiti of Zelensky caricatured as a homeless person in Los Angeles, an image that another account would in turn ask media outlets to verify, and so on (T0039.001: Collaborating Assets Seed and Ping).<br><br>The videos that need to be verified are, in the vast majority of cases, mimicking the style of major French and international media outlets (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). [...] <br><br>The data provided by "Antibot4Navalny," which AFP investigated, documents the existence of dozens, if not hundreds, of profiles using this strategy of mass media harassment. Most of these are accounts abandoned by their owners and then hacked (T0150.005: Compromised Asset). A sign that these accounts have been taken over by bots is that posts sometimes appear at a rate of one per minute, effectively flooding social media. <br><br>AFP's analysis also revealed that accounts that ask media outlets to verify fake news will themselves spread it some time later.<br><br>Misappropriation of military aid to Ukraine, truncated or invented Zelensky graffiti (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage) and fake advertisements on Times Square: these publications always implicate Ukrainians and seek to stir up the idea of  |
