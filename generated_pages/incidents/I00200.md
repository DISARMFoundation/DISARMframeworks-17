The quote has been wrongly attributed to the 39th president of the U.S. It was said by comedian John Fugelsang (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution, T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>Most iterations of the claim feature a photograph of Carter and read: “If you don't want your tax dollars to help the poor, then stop saying that you want a country based on Christian values. Because you don't!"<br><br>[...]<br><br>Earlier iterations of the quote on social media dating back to 2013 do not refer to Jimmy Carter but to the actor and comedian John Fugelsang.<br><br>Fugelsang confirmed to Reuters via Twitter direct message that the quote is indeed his and not Carter's.<br><br>He made this remark on the talk show Viewpoint, featured on Current TV. Reuters was unable to find the segment, which is no longer available on Current TV’s website. Snopes, who debunked the claim back in 2014 (T0160.007: Claim Previously Fact Checked), reported that the segment aired on May 29, 2013 and provides a transcript of Fugelsang’s full quote .<br><br>During the segment, Fugelsang made this remark to criticize Tennessee congressman Stephen Fincher, who had recently quoted a Bible passage to allegedly justify billions of dollars in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (cs.pn/2Z3AGOP ).</i> |
