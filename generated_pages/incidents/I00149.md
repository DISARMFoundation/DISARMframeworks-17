| [T0162.005 Video Game Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0162.005.md) | <i>Footage from a video game has been miscaptioned as saying it shows UFOs flying over Nevada (T0162.005: Video Game Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality). Other online posts use the clip to fuel a conspiracy called Project Blue Beam, which says the U.S. government falsifies UFO footage.<br><br>Both claims are false, as the footage stems from Digital Combat Simulator (DCS), a free-to-play combat flight simulation game.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Some shared the clip with the caption: “was project blue beam on your 2023 bingo card? Certainly no coincidence the government tells us all about ‘aliens’ and now we get crystal clear footage”.<br><br>The posts reference the July 26 U.S. House hearing on UFOs (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>References to Project Blue Beam in the posts and comments refer to a conspiracy theory that the government will coordinate events that will lead people to adopt a new religion to establish a so-called New World Order.<br><br>Believers of the conspiracy do not presume the existence of aliens and express a distrust in government, Joseph A. Vitriol, an expert in conspiracy theories and professor at Lehigh University, said in a phone interview.<br><br>“What it focuses on is the expectation that the government will create a false narrative or a false flag of an alien-type invasion or some big event,” he said. “Project Blue Beam is saying this clip is fake, and the government is using this fake event as part of a broader attempt to implement a New World Order.”<br><br>The social media clip was first shared by TikTok user @iceman_fox1 with the caption: “BREAKING: Three UFO's are intercepted by USAF F-22 Raptors over the central Nevada desert”.<br><br>An identical clip can be seen on the @iceman_fox1’s Instagram page. However, both posts by the user note that it was “Filmed with Digital Combat Simulator.”<br><br>User @iceman_fox1 said in an email: “I create multiple videos a week of random military/sci-fi content,” confirming the clip was generated with the Digital Combat Simulator game.</i> |
