| [T0068 Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0068.md) | <i>A video of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un making a speech has been claimed to show him commenting on the Israel-Gaza conflict [...]<br><br>A caption on the video states: “Kim Jong-un speech about Israel Palestine war [sic].” (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis)The fake subtitles say: “Under the Biden administration conflicts erupt yearly. This year a war begins between Israel and Palestine. Last year a war begins [sic] between Russia and Ukraine and two years ago billions worth of military equipment was left to the Taliban. <br><br>“I’m afraid that if the Biden admin. does not cease to exist in the next election World War 3 may begin. Who knows what next year’s war will be. I support Donald Trump for president in 2024. Good luck to Mr Trump”.<br><br>But the video predates the current conflict (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current) and the subtitles are fake (T0162.001: Incorrect Subtitled Speech Reframes Context). <br><br>Kim Jong Un was actually speaking at a military parade to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the ruling party and thanked citizens for overcoming unexpected obstacles. According to Politico, he “extended an olive branch” to South Korea and “avoided direct criticism of Washington”.<br><br>The video was taken in October 2020, before the current Israel-Gaza conflict or the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. It also predates the US election in November 2020, when President Biden was elected.<br><br>A section of the footage being shared (T0165.001: Clipped Content) matches video from BBC reporting of his speech (T0162.002: Edits Made to News Report which Reframe Context). The BBC doesn’t feature a direct translation of all that he said, but text on screen says: “He said no one could appreciate [North Korean troops’] ‘heroic devotion’ without ‘shedding tears of gratitude’.”</i> |
