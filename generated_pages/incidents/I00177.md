Similar claims circulated on Facebook and X, formerly Twitter.<br><br>Our rating: False<br><br>The study cited in the post does not conclude COVID-19 vaccines were linked to the excess deaths (T0163.002: Narrative Misrepresents Findings of Cited Academic Research). It encouraged further studies to identify the causes.<br><br>Excess deaths remain high with no cause identified<br><br>The study referenced in the post and article was published June 3 in BMJ Public Health, a publication of the British Medical Journal. In it, researchers from the Netherlands stated that excess mortality in Western nations remained high from 2020 to 2022, even after the adoption of preventative measures and vaccines to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19.<br><br>While noting the correlation, the study was explicit in its conclusion – and the British Medical Journal reiterated in a follow-up statement – that the research did not identify a cause of the excess deaths.<br><br>“Excess mortality has remained high in the Western World for three consecutive years, despite the implementation of containment measures and COVID-19 vaccines,” the study’s conclusion reads. “This raises serious concerns. Government leaders and policymakers need to thoroughly investigate underlying causes of persistent excess mortality.”<br><br>As the misrepresentation of the report spread, the British Medical Journal released a statement further stressing that researchers didn't identify a cause for the excess deaths.<br><br>“The researchers looked only at trends in excess mortality over time, not its causes,” the statement said in part. “While the researchers recognize that side effects are reported after vaccination, the research does not support the claim that vaccines are a major contributory factor to excess deaths since the start of the pandemic. Vaccines have, in fact, been instrumental in reducing the severe illness and death associated with COVID-19 infection.”<br><br>The statement also notes that different methods of data reporting and varying data quality from nation to nation further complicate identifying causal relationships.</i> |
