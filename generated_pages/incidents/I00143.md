| [T0162.011 Content Originally Produced as Satire Presented as Not Satire](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0162.011.md) | <i>A claim being shared online that the US state of Texas has declared bringing an LGBTQ pride flag into a school classroom a “crime” originates from a satirical news article.<br><br>Posts sharing the claim on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook—sometimes include a link to a page with a full story and other versions have a screenshot including the headline: “It’s Official: Texas Declares Bringing a Pride Flag to the Classroom a Crime.”<br><br>Many of the accounts posting or commenting on it on social media appear to believe it is a genuine policy (T0162.011: Content Originally Produced as Satire Presented as Not Satire).<br><br>The website it originates from tags the article under ‘satire’ (T0160.005: Content Produced as Satire). It reports that the bill is titled “The Classroom Sanctity Act”. We can find no evidence that a bill of this name or nature has been tabled or approved by lawmakers in Texas.<br><br>The article also quotes Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott as saying at a signing ceremony of the bill: “No child in Texas should ever be exposed to a rainbow unless it’s in a coloring book, a weather forecast, or the Lucky Charms aisle at the grocery store.” (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)<br><br>We can also find no evidence that he ever said this, or that such a signing took place.</i> |
