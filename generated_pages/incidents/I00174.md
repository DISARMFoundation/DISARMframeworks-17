Some researchers rely on and use discredited research in their work (T0163.003: Narrative Cites Retracted Academic Research) — even years after a journal has withdrawn the research from publication because problems such as scientific misconduct, significant errors, plagiarism or ethics violations have rendered those results untrustworthy.<br><br>Lead author Stylianos “Stelios” Serghiou explained the new study highlights key problems in the pipeline for communicating science to the public. In an email interview, he stressed the need to correct the scientific record as well as the public record following a retraction, “especially in the case of consequential or highly popularized articles.”<br><br>“When highly popularized research is retracted, we need to consider the obligation to inform the public that this research is no longer considered credible by the scientific community,” Serghiou, who has a medical degree and completed a doctoral degree in epidemiology and clinical research at Stanford University last year, wrote to The Journalist’s Resource.<br><br>The best way to do that, though, is unclear, Serghiou and his colleagues explain in their new paper. When they looked at how people discussed a small sample of retractions on social media, they discovered that, in some cases, “retraction was directly or indirectly associated with the promotion of the initial misinformation.”<br><br>Even though thousands of papers have been retracted over time, they remain rare. About 4 in 10,000 papers are retracted, Science magazine reported in 2018. Retraction Watch, a project of the nonprofit Center for Scientific Integrity, tracks retractions and has built a database of more than 26,000 retractions going back to 1756.<br><br>[...]<br><br>- Most papers and their retractions tend to draw similar amounts of attention from news outlets, social media and other sources. But the most popular papers received 2.5 times as much attention before they were retracted than afterward.<br><br>- A median 457 days passed between a paper’s publication and its retraction.<br><br>- Of the retracted papers examined, 31 were cited more than 100 times each in other research.<br><br>- The most common reason for retraction during the study period was duplication, when a researcher or group of researchers publish the same information in two different papers. The second most common was “fake peer review,” meaning the authors cheated — intentionally or unintentionally — the peer-review process through which scholars vet and evaluate one another’s work. Plagiarism was the third most common reason.<br><br>- Tumor Biology had the largest retraction during the study period. In 2017, the journal published a retraction note withdrawing 103 articles due to fake peer review.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Serghiou explained that journalists should report on retractions to correct the public record, but it’s unclear the best way to do that. He told JR there could be unintended consequences when journalists correct the record — potentially spurring social media users to promote the retracted findings as valid.<br><br>One retracted paper they studied, published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2012, claimed that putting an Elmo sticker on an apple encouraged children to choose apples over cookies. Before its retraction, people tweeted about the paper four times. The retraction, Serghiou noted, led to a flurry of tweets promoting the invalid finding. Someone tweeted a sentence suggesting stickers make children choose fruit over cookies and it was retweeted 742 times (T0163.003: Narrative Cites Retracted Academic Research).<br><br>“In our limited study of tweets about recent popular retracted articles, we were very surprised to witness that retraction without appropriate communication may lead to inadvertent promotion of the results being retracted,” Serghiou wrote to JR.</i> |
