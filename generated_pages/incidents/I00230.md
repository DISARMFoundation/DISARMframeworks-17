The assertion was false (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>The rumor stemmed from videos uploaded by purported celebrity gossip channels on YouTube. The videos had titles like "Mike Wolfe Sentenced For Frank Frits's Death, Goodbye Forever," implying that Wolfe had been arrested (and charged, and sentenced) for the death of his former co-host, Frank Fritz. Fritz died on Sept. 30, 2024, according to an Instagram post Wolfe made the following day.<br><br>Artificial intelligence video-creation tools seemingly helped create the videos' narration, scripting, and sequencing (T0166: AI-Generated Content). Without naming an explicit source for its information, one video's narrator said:<br><br>“Mike Wolfe's sentencing stunned viewers across America when the "American Pickers" star was led away in handcuffs. Everyone thought his arrest was related to some dispute over antiques or perhaps a business disagreement with the History Channel. According to breaking news reports, Wolfe was arrested because the death of his former co-host, Frank Fritz, wasn't from natural causes as initially reported. Instead, investigators now classify it as premeditated murder. Medical reports indicate Fritz was found with lethal amounts of medication in his system. He was deliberately overdosed, and prosecutors grabbed Wolfe for the murder because it was calculated not accidental.”<br><br>That YouTube video had been viewed more than 272,000 times, as of this writing. Other YouTube videos sharing the same claim, or variations on it, also had large view counts. Posts on social media sites like Facebook also spread the supposed news.<br><br>There was no evidence to support the assertion that Wolfe had been arrested, and certainly no evidence he was arrested on charges of killing Fritz. If there was even a sliver of truth to the claim — for instance, if Wolfe had been arrested on different charges — reputable entertainment media outlets would have interviewed parties involved and documented the ordeal. That had not happened.<br><br>In short, the claim appeared to be made up from whole cloth for the purpose of gaining views online. A disclaimer at the bottom of the YouTube video read: <br><br>"Context of Information: The views and information shared in Niwra's videos are drawn from current news, reports, and personal insights. They are provided for educational and informational purposes only and may not always reflect the latest developments or offer a full perspective on the topics discussed."<br><br>Despite the fact that the video's underlying claim was false, the clip about Wolfe could seem believable because Fritz did die in September 2024, from the long-term effects of a stroke. Additionally, an unrelated Oregon man named Michael Wolfe was sentenced to life in prison in 2022 for murdering a woman and her child.<br><br>That small amount of truth inside a mountain of misleading information, combined with emotionally charged language, is a recipe that allows baseless celebrity rumors to go viral, and generate hundreds or thousands of comments from YouTube users.
