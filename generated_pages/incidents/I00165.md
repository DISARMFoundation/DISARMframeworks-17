| [T0162.010 Entertainment Media Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0162.010.md) | <i>A video is being shared online with the implication that it shows “Rafah actors” preparing to pretend to be dead or injured in Gaza. This comes amidst reports Israel appears to be set to launch a large-scale assault on the city in the south of Gaza.<br><br>In the clip, which is circulating on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, and shared over 4,000 times on X (formerly Twitter), a man lies on a stretcher while a woman applies makeup to his chest and neck, and another man sits in what appears to be a body bag—while smoking a cigarette. <br><br>Text overlaid on the video says “Make-up Gaza Style” and has a watermark of an account which shares what it claims are “Pallywood” videos—a portmanteau of Palestine and Bollywood. <br><br>Full Fact has written several times about this term, which in some cases has been previously used to caption videos or images incorrectly claiming to show those in Gaza faking images of harm to civilians during the war. <br><br>A caption with one post sharing the video on Facebook says: “Rafah actors are preparing, and we may soon witness disturbing footage from Rafah.”<br><br>But this video actually shows behind-the-scenes footage of a Palestinian drama series, called Bleeding Dirt (T0162.010: Entertainment Media Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality), and is unrelated to Israel’s planned military offensive in Rafah (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>The actors in the clip being shared can be seen in the same makeup and costume during an episode of the show, available online. The description with the video says it premiered on 12 March 2024. <br><br>According to Palestinian fact checkers Kashif, the scene was filmed in a town near Nablus, in the West Bank, not Gaza.</i> |
