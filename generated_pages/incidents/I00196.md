Are your demands greater than my likes? Is it because you use intimidation, blackmail and force to get your way- that you do? Let’s make a deal. I will leave what you like alone and you leave what I like alone and the world will be a better place for everyone. copy and paste or share (T0120: Incentivise Sharing) cause it’s exactly how I feel!! ENOUGH already people!!!” <br><br>Hank Williams Jr is an American musician and the son of country musician Hank Williams. When asked about the 2016 election, Williams told Rolling Stone: “’What about the election?’ they say. I say, ‘I don’t give a shit about the election, I’ve got a smash CD coming out!'”. Williams has been outspoken about politics in the past. <br><br>The posts do not give a time or place where Williams said this and Reuters could not find any evidence of the quote being authentic. The quote appears on meme pages, social media posts and blogs. It does not appear on Williams’ social media or website.  <br><br>Williams’ representative Ken Levitan confirmed to Reuters via email: "This is a fabricated quote.” (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution, T0160.002: Information is False)</i> |
