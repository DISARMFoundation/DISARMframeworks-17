| [T0162.010 Entertainment Media Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0162.010.md) | <i>A video is circulating on social media alongside claims it shows an actor in Gaza who is accidentally limping on the wrong foot. <br><br>The posts say the actor “pretends to be a ‘victim’” and that “the media is lying to us about what's happening in Gaza. Why would they need to act if there was an actual genocide?”<br><br>But the video actually shows a comedy skit (T0162.010: Entertainment Media Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality, T0162.011: Content Originally Produced as Satire Presented as Not Satire) filmed in Baghdad, Iraq (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location), which was uploaded to Instagram on 8 December. It is unrelated to the current conflict in the Middle East.<br><br>That account appears to belong to a shop selling cleaning products, cosmetics and electrical items and its Instagram bio lists its location as an address in Baghdad, Iraq. Searching images of the Bab al-Derwaza Market mentioned in the bio, Full Fact was able to find a picture which matched the buildings and street signs in the back of the video, confirming it was filmed at this location in Iraq, not Gaza. The original video’s caption makes no mention of Gaza or Palestinians.<br><br>In a later post commenting on the video’s spread, and misattribution to Gaza, the account holder confirms the video was filmed in Baghdad and questions why the video ended up being wrongly connected to Gaza. <br><br>The fact that the video is being shared with captions suggesting the man in it is an actor in Gaza pretending to be a victim appears to echo a narrative, often referred to as ‘Pallywood’ (a portmanteau of Palestine and Bollywood), which has been used online to describe the alleged false staging of harm to Palestinian civilians.</i> |
