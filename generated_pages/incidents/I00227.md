# Incident I00227: False claim CDC reported spike in HIV-related diseases after COVID-19 vaccines | Fact check

* **Summary:** <i>The claim: CDC reports jump in 'AIDS-associated diseases and cancers' since rollout of COVID-19 vaccines<br><br>[...]<br><br>Our rating: False. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention never reported such an increase and said it hasn't found a link between the COVID-19 vaccines and HIV or cancer. An expert told USA TODAY there is no evidence to support the claim. The website that originally made the claim used numbers from an unverified database that allows anyone to submit reports of adverse vaccine side effects.</i>
