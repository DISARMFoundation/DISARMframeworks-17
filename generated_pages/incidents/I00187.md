| [T0164.003 Narrative Uses Misinterpreted Statistics to Support Claim](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0164.003.md) | <i>An inaccurate article has resurfaced on social media to wrongly suggest 99% of COVID-19 deaths were primarily caused by something other than the virus (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>Social media posts shared a screenshot of a long-since corrected Mail Online headline about weekly COVID fatalities in the U.S.<br><br>“99% of 'Covid deaths' not primarily caused by the virus, CDC data shows,” said the headline in the screenshot, referring to figures published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the week ending Aug. 19, 2023.<br><br>The posts suggested the screenshot was evidence the COVID pandemic was a scam.<br><br>“We, the allegedly dangerous conspiracy theorists, were right from the start. The measures were deadly, not the common cold itself,” said one Dec. 10, 2024, post sharing the screenshot on X, which received more than 315,000 views.<br><br>However, the original article and its headline misrepresented the CDC data (T0164.003: Narrative Uses Misinterpreted Statistics to Support Claim), which initially indicated 1.7% of total U.S. deaths in the week to Aug. 19, 2023, were primarily due to COVID.<br><br>The article, published on Aug. 28, 2023, interpreted the data as showing deaths where COVID was the primary cause as a percentage of all COVID-linked deaths.<br><br>The Mail Online updated the article on Aug. 29, 2023, with a new headline that said: “Covid to blame for just 1% of weekly deaths from all causes across the US, CDC data shows.”<br><br>At the bottom of the article, it said: “An earlier version of this article claimed 99 percent of Covid deaths in the past week were not primarily caused by the virus. In fact, a footnote at the bottom of the CDC's Covid data tracker explains the percentage of all reported deaths attributed as Covid-19 is calculated based on the number of deaths from all causes. We have amended the article to reflect this.”<br><br>[...]<br><br>The CDC data showed 1.7% of all deaths - later updated to 1.6% - were primarily caused by COVID, not that 99% of COVID-related deaths were caused by something other than the virus. The Mail Online corrected its headline in 2023.</i> |
