Despite Slovakia’s NATO membership, Pellegrini has said he would oppose sending the country’s armed forces to assist a member state if it were attacked by Russia.<br><br>The false story published on Tuesday in both Czech and English said that the fictitious attempted assassination of Pellegrini was planned by Ukrainian nationals. It named Vitaliy Usatyy, Kyiv’s charge d’affaires in Prague, as one of the perpetrators.<br><br>CTK described the incident as an act of disinformation. No evidence has yet been published tying the hack to a particular actor, and the news agency said it would not be releasing further information.</i> |
