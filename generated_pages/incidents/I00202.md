| [T0161.002 Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0161.002.md) | <i>Social media users have been sharing content online that attributes a quote exposing Hollywood elites as pedophiles to actor Mel Gibson. This claim is false; the quote is fabricated (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution, T0160.002: Information is False). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Some posts use this quote: “Hollywood is an institutionalized pedophile ring. It is a den of parasites who feast on the blood of children. Every studio in Hollywood is bought and paid for with the blood of innocent children.” <br><br>The comment seems to stem from an article originally published on NewsPunch.com (T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), previously “Your News Wire”. It has since been deleted, but archived versions can be found  archive.vn/FyeKl ; and  archive.is/SuTTt ; . <br><br>The article claims that Gibson explained to guests in a green room after appearing on the Graham Norton Show about the “real nature of Hollywood elites”.  <br><br>A well-known actor speaking to a crowd of people about this topic would have gathered a lot of attention and been reported by major news organizations. However, a Google search of the quote only brings up social media posts, blogs and meme pages. <br><br>The original article including the quote was written by Baxter Dmitry, a possible pseudonym (T0143.002: Fabricated Persona) for an author who has been criticized for writing fake news articles. The website YourNewsWire has also been criticized for producing inaccurate content. Dmitry  is still a frequent contributor to NewsPunch. <br><br>The article has been copied or slightly altered (T0165: Edited Content) and published to other websites and blogs, which has led to the wide circulation of the quote. <br><br>[...]<br><br>A spokesperson for Mel Gibson told Reuters via email that the claims are “100% fake”. <br><br>VERDICT<br><br>False. This quote attributed to Mel Gibson originated from a fabricated article.</i> |
