# Incident I00188: Fact check: CDC's data on COVID-19 deaths used incorrectly in misleading claims

* **Summary:** <i>A regular update of data on COVID-19 deaths by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has prompted a groundswell of claims that only a fraction of people have actually died directly from the novel coronavirus.<br><br>The misleading and inaccurate conclusions come from recently released statistics on comorbidities data in the CDC's weekly coronavirus update, with statistics as of Aug. 26.</i>
