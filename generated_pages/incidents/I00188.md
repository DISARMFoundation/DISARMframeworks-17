For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death,” the report reads.<br><br>The data, which is maintained by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, is an aggregated list of comorbidities on death certificates reported to the agency.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The CDC defines a comorbidity as when “more than one disease or condition is present in the same person at the same time.” A comorbidity is often a chronic condition that a person can live with, such as arthritis, diabetes or obesity.<br><br>When a person dies, the cause and manner of death of death are determined separately from any comorbidities that may have been present. A person who takes his own life, for instance, has suicide listed for a cause of death, with any comorbidities he may have had documented separately.<br><br>The CDC regularly records comorbidities data for a range of diseases affecting Americans, including cancer and opioid overdoses.<br><br>As with COVID-19, it is possible that a person’s preexisting conditions exacerbated his or her death in the case of a drug overdose, for instance, but it is inaccurate to say the main cause of death was not the overdose itself.<br><br>“It seems clear that comorbidities, leading to compromised immune systems, play an important role in COVID-19 deaths, and in such cases attributing deaths to a single cause is at best questionable,” Roderick Little, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Michigan, told USA TODAY.<br><br>[...]<br><br>“These data come from death certificates, and the death certificate is designed to only capture information on causes of death,” Anderson said, explaining that COVID-19 would then not be "an incidental or trivial factor."<br><br>"The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person’s death," Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications at the National Center for Health Statistics, told PolitiFact.<br><br>"In 92% of all deaths that mention COVID-19, COVID-19 is listed as the underlying cause of death," Lancashire said.</i> |
