| [T0163.002 Narrative Misrepresents Findings of Cited Academic Research](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0163.002.md) | <i>A Sept. 4 Instagram post (direct link, archive link) shows a screenshot of a post on X, formerly Twitter, that claims a particular vaccine has been linked to shorter lifespans.<br><br>"BREAKING: According to new CDC data, the Covid vaccine could take 24 years off of your life," reads the post.<br><br>The post was liked more than 1,000 times in two weeks. The X post appears to have been deleted.<br><br>There is no evidence any data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a link between COVID-19 vaccines and lower life expectancy. The dataset cited in a related article wasn't released until months after the claim was made. The claim originated with a website that frequently publishes misinformation.<br><br>The claim appears to stem from a Feb. 8 article posted on a website called "The Expose," which has previously published vaccine-related misinformation.<br><br>The article cites a study that looked at the effectiveness of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine among Cleveland Clinic employees. The study found the vaccine "afforded modest protection overall" when given to working-age adults. It did not address life expectancy (T0163.002: Narrative Misrepresents Findings of Cited Academic Research).<br><br>The article also claims the CDC's all-cause mortality data shows "each vaccine dose" increased mortality by 7% from 2021 to 2022. However, provisional mortality data for 2022 from the CDC wasn't released until May 5, nearly three months after the article was published (T0164.001: Narrative Presents Fabricated Statistics as Genuine Data). It says the "overall age-adjusted U.S. death rate decreased by 5.3% from 2021 to 2022."</i> |
