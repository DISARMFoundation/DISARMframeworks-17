| [T0162.005 Video Game Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0162.005.md) | <i>A clip of two fighter jets created using a combat simulation videogame has been shared online as depicting a September 2024 incident in which a Russian jet flew close to a U.S. plane during an intercept by the U.S. military (T0162.005: Video Game Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality).<br><br>Reuters reported that on Sept. 23, a Russian Su-35 aircraft conducted an unsafe maneuver during a routine aerial intercept by a North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) F-16 aircraft in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>The online video shows a fighter jet approaching another from behind and crossing over to the other side. “A U.S. Air Force F-16 is provoked by a Russian Sukhoi Su-35 in the skies of Alaska,” said Facebook posts with the footage (T0162.005: Video Game Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality).<br><br>The online clip, however, is visibly different from the original footage by the Department of Defense, published on Sept. 30.<br><br>The video in the posts can be traced to an Oct. 1 post on YouTube (timestamp 0:13) (T0165.001: Clipped Content) titled “New Angles: SU-35's Dangerous Flyby Over Alaska – DCS World,” by the channel “MasterArm” which regularly uploads scenes created using digital battlefield game Digital Combat Simulator World (DCS).<br><br>The account’s owner, who took credit for making the clip, said in an email to Reuters that all the videos on the channel are created using the DCS World simulator game, adding: “It is not the first time when my videos are taken and published with another title and some think they are real.”</i> |
