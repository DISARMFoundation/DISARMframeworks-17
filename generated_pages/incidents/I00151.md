While Pakistan claims to have downed five Indian warplanes and both sides said they had destroyed scores of drones during the worst violence between the nuclear-armed neighbours in decades, the clips circulating online were taken from the video game Arma 3 (T0162.005: Video Game Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>Videos purportedly showing fighter jets being shot down were shared on Facebook and Instagram as fighting erupted along India and Pakistan's contested frontier on May 7, 2025.<br><br>They exchanged heavy artillery fire after New Delhi launched deadly missile strikes on its arch-rival, in the worst violence between the nuclear-armed neighbours in decades.<br><br>The fighting came two weeks after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for backing an attack on the Indian-run side of disputed Kashmir, which Pakistan denied.<br><br>The Burmese-language caption of the Facebook video reads: "Indian fighter jets have entered and attacked Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It's been said that five Indian fighter jets were shot down by Pakistan missiles." (T0162.005: Video Game Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis)<br><br>Superimposed text on the Instagram video, meanwhile, says it shows an "Automatic Attack by Raddar (sic)" that was filmed on May 6. (T0162.005: Video Game Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis)<br><br>The days of deadly attacks were halted by a ceasefire agreed on May 10 -- news surprisingly announced by US President Donald Trump, who congratulated New Delhi and Islamabad on using "common sense".<br><br>[...]<br><br>A combination of keyword searches and reverse image searches using keyframes from the first falsely shared video led to a higher-definition clip shared on Facebook on April 19.<br><br>"This is my own video created from a game called Arma 3," the user told AFP on Facebook Messenger on May 10, adding it was "unrelated to the current war".<br><br>Arma 3, a tactical shooter simulation created by Czech video game developer Bohemia Interactive, allows players to create their own combat simulations using realistic military gear. </i> |
