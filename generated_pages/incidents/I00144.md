| [T0161.002 Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0161.002.md) | <i>A quote about Trump supporters feeling “the vengeance of a nation” if the Democrats are re-elected is circulating on social media and being falsely attributed to Kamala Harris.<br><br>Posts sharing the quote have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), and also Facebook, with claims it was said by the now-Democratic presidential candidate in June 2020 (T0162.011: Content Originally Produced as Satire Presented as Not Satire).<br><br>It reads: “Once Trump’s gone and we have regained our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported him and endorsed his actions because we’ll be coming for you next.<br><br>“You will feel the vengeance of a nation. No stone will be left unturned as we seek you out in this great nation. For it is you that betrayed us.”<br><br>But this is not a genuine quote from the Vice President (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>The text originates from a satire website called ‘bustatroll’, which published it in an article in 2019. Its about page says: “Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real.”<br><br>While the website is no longer active, an archived version of the story can be found online, which is apparently authored by ‘Colon Crusher’. <br><br>It is marked as “Satire and/or Conservative Fan Fiction” (T0160.005: Content Produced as Satire) underneath the headline: “Kamala Harris: ‘After We Impeach, We Round Up The Trump Supporters’”.<br><br>In the same satirical article, Ms Harris is claimed to have also said “the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men”—a quote from the film Pulp Fiction and is accompanied by a photo of Samuel L Jackson, whose character in the movie said that line.<br><br>The same quote being shared online was also previously debunked by US fact checkers in 2020 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked).</i> |
