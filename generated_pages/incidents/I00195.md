| [T0161.002 Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0161.002.md) | <i>Social media users have been sharing images online with a quote attributed to designer Michael Kors that says, “I’m tired of pretending that I like blacks.” This claim is false (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution, T0160.002: Information is False). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Some versions of the post show a screenshot from a 2015 article on now-deleted website, nahadaily.com [...] The website discloses at the bottom of the page that it is satire (T0143.004: Parody Persona).  <br><br>Another version shows a screenshot of a tweet from an account called “TMZ Breaking News”, featuring the same wording from the satirical article (T0162.011: Content Originally Produced as Satire Presented as Not Satire). The account uses TMZ’s name and logo but discloses in its bio that it is not actually affiliated TMZ. (T0143.003: Impersonated Persona).<br><br>[...] Although the claim stems from a satirical article, it has since been taken seriously.  <br><br>A quote of this nature from well-known designer Michael Kors would have been reported on widely by major news organizations. Reuters found no evidence Kors made this statement. <br><br>Michael Kors released several statements in support of the Black Lives Matter movement on social media.</i> |
