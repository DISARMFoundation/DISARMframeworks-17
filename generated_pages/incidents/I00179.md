| [T0039.001 Collaborating Assets Seed and Ping](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0039.001.md) | <i>The Ethics and Public Policy Center, a think tank that says it opposes “the extreme progressive agenda while building consensus of conservatives,” recently issued a report on a key abortion medication, mifepristone, that it says raises questions about its safety. After analyzing insurance claims for more than 865,000 prescribed mifepristone abortions, the group said it had determined that almost 11 percent of women experienced a “serious adverse event,” much higher than an overall 0.5 percent rate found in clinical studies.<br><br>That headline number led Republicans like Sen. Josh Hawley (Missouri) to declare that the abortion pill is dangerous. “Those are astounding, jaw-dropping numbers, and they have been largely hidden from the public,” he said in an opinion article in the Federalist. An adverse health event, he noted, is “a major, potentially life-threatening medical disaster. We’re talking about things like sepsis, infection, and hemorrhaging, the kind of things that land you in an ER.”<br><br>Citing the report, Hawley on Thursday secured a commitment from Jim O’Neill, the Trump administration nominee for deputy secretary of Health and Human Services, to review the safety of mifepristone.<br><br>A medication abortion using a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol in 2023 accounted for 63 percent of abortions, double the percentage in 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Since 1988, about 100 countries have approved the use of mifepristone, according to Gynuity Health Projects, which also favors abortion rights.<br><br>We dug into the EPPC report, which calls the use of mifepristone “chemical abortions,” and posed 20 questions to EPPC, which were answered in detail via email by spokesman Hunter Estes after consultation with the researchers. The report lists 94,605 adverse events, for a rate of 10.93 percent, between 2017 and 2023. (Some women had more than one event, so the report says it avoided double-counting when calculating overall rate.) But the headline number seems less solid when the individual data presented in the report is examined.<br><br>We should note that, unlike most credible medical studies, the report did not undergo a formal external peer review before publication (T0163.004: Narrative Cites Academic Research not Peer Reviewed). Estes said “the study was internally reviewed and adjudicated by a panel of physicians, who carefully evaluated the clinical classifications, coding, and outcome assessments to ensure medical accuracy and consistency.”</i> |

Josh Hawley (Missouri) to declare that the abortion pill is dangerous. “Those are astounding, jaw-dropping numbers, and they have been largely hidden from the public,” he said in an opinion article in the Federalist.

The report lists 94,605 adverse events, for a rate of 10.93 percent, between 2017 and 2023.

The report lists 94,605 adverse events, for a rate of 10.93 percent, between 2017 and 2023. (Some women had more than one event, so the report says it avoided double-counting when calculating overall rate.) But the headline number seems less solid when the individual data presented in the report is examined.<br><br>We should note that, unlike most credible medical studies, the report did not undergo a formal external peer review before publication (T0163.004: Narrative Cites Academic Research not Peer Reviewed). Estes said “the study was internally reviewed and adjudicated by a panel of physicians, who carefully evaluated the clinical classifications, coding, and outcome assessments to ensure medical accuracy and consistency.”</i> |
