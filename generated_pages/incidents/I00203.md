| [T0161.002 Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0161.002.md) | <i>Nearly two years after the 2020 presidential election, former President Donald Trump and his supporters continue to claim the election was rigged. On Aug. 29, Trump demanded to either be instated as the rightful president of the U.S. or have the country perform "a new election, immediately!"<br><br>A recent social media post claims President Joe Biden's daughter-in-law is backing the debunked claim that Trump won in 2020 (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>An Aug. 30 Facebook post claims Hallie Biden tweeted support for Trump and his performance in the 2020 presidential election.<br><br>"President Trump won that election and my entire family knows it," the supposed tweet reads.<br><br>The post garnered more than 90 likes in two weeks. A previous version garnered more than 100 likes in its first four days before it was deleted. Screenshots of other tweets purportedly shared by Hallie Biden have been published on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.<br><br>USA TODAY and other fact-checkers have repeatedly debunked false and misleading claims that Trump won the 2020 election, as an array of recounts and audits by election officials from both parties have confirmed the legitimacy of Biden's win. <br><br>The purported Hallie Biden tweet is also false – in both its content and attribution.<br><br>A spokesperson for Hallie Biden said the Twitter account was run by an imposter (T0143.003: Impersonated Persona), not Hallie Biden. It has since been suspended.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The tweet in question did not come from Hallie Biden, as she doesn't use the platform.<br><br>"Mrs. Hallie Biden does not have a Twitter account," a spokesperson for the Beau Biden Foundation, a charity organization for which Hallie Biden is a board chair, told USA TODAY in an emailed statement. "Any account bearing her name is fraudulent." <br><br>The account was suspended sometime between Aug. 31 and Sept. 2, according to online archives. </i> |
