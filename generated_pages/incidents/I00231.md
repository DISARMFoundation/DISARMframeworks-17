# Incident I00231: Naga Munchetty: Scammers spread fake nude pictures of me on social media

* **Summary:** <i>"Naga Munchetti: This is the most humiliating day of my life. Yesterday's news shocked the whole of the UK."<br><br>The headline was enough to make me want to read more – but the fact they had spelled my name wrong made me immediately question the credibility of the journalism involved – if there was any.<br><br>I'm used to seeing misleading articles about myself online, but the screenshots I've been sent by friends and followers on social media in recent weeks are a lot more insidious than most.<br><br>Paid-for advertisements are popping up across X and Facebook, some including crudely mocked-up images of me naked – my face badly photoshopped onto someone else's body.<br><br>I was both mortified and bemused, curious about who would pay good money to spread such obvious nonsense. And what was their motive? Is it something malicious? Someone with an axe to grind?<br><br>I discussed it with my 5 Live production team, and we began to dig into it more. It soon became apparent that my name and image were being used by scammers to try to hoodwink people out of money.</i>
