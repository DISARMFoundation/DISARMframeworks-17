| [T0160.005 Content Produced as Satire](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0160.005.md) | <i>Posts claiming Elon Musk has invested $1 billion or more “into Mel Gibson and Mark Wahlberg’s ‘un-woke’ film studio committed to traditional family values” are circulating on social media. But they aren’t true, and originated from a satirical website (T0160.005: Content Produced as Satire).<br><br>Several other fact checkers debunked similar claims earlier this year (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked). Many of the posts use similar language to the headline in a satirical article, which said: “Breaking: Elon Musk Invests $1 Billion in Mel Gibson and Mark Wahlberg’s New Un-Woke Production Studio”.<br><br>The website this article appeared on describes itself as a “one-stop destination for satirical news and commentary about the United States of America” which is “dedicated to bringing you the latest and greatest in fake news and absurdity”. (T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0143.004: Parody Persona)<br><br>The article page itself is also labeled “satire”.</i> |
