* **Summary:** <i>“A Chinese disinformation network operating fictitious employee personas across the internet used a front company in London to recruit content creators and translators around the world, according to Meta.<br><br> “In a report published Wednesday, Meta revealed it had removed more than 100 accounts on Facebook and dozens on Instagram connected to the operation targeting “multiple internet services,” including almost all of the major social media platforms.<br><br> “The operation used a company called London New Europe Media, registered to an address on the upmarket Kensington High Street, that attempted to recruit real people to help it produce content. It is not clear how many people it ultimately recruited.<br><br> “London New Europe Media also “tried to engage individuals to record English-language videos scripted by the network,” in one case leading to a recording criticizing the United States being posted on YouTube, said Meta.<br><br> “While the actual operators of this network attempted to conceal their identities, Meta said its investigation had "found links to individuals in China associated with Xi'an Tainwendian Network Technology, an information technology company.”</I>

Many members post nearly identical comments at almost the same time. The text includes markers of automatic translation while error messages included as profile photos indicate the automated pulling of stock images.”</i><br><br> In this example analysts found an indicator of automated use of stock images in Facebook accounts; some of the accounts in the network appeared to have mistakenly uploaded error messages as profile pictures (T0145.007: Stock Image Account Imagery). The text posted by the accounts also appeared to have been translated using automation (T0085.008: Machine Translated Text). |
