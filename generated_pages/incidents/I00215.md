# Incident I00215: MATRYOSHKA: A pro-Russian campaign targeting media and the fact-checking community

* **Summary:** <i>Since late 2023, VIGINUM has observed and documented a malicious campaign that could affect French-speaking public debate online. <br><br>This operation, dubbed “Matryoshka” (Russian doll) in previous open sources reports, has been active since at least September 2023. Its primary aim is to post fake content (reports, graffiti, memes, etc.), which is then shared in a coordinated manner on X (formerly Twitter), in the reply section of posts by the accounts of media outlets, public figures and factchecking organizations in more than 60 countries. Matryoshka operators contact their targets directly on X and via email to ask them to investigate the fake content. <br><br>The fake content generally impersonates North American and European public figures and media outlets, including French ones. Although primarily anti-Ukrainian narratives are spread and amplified, this content also targets France’s Ukraine support policy, French politicians, and the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. <br><br>VIGINUM investigations have established that most of the content was first published on Russian-language Telegram channels, which had already been identified in information operations. VIGINUM considers that the aim of the Matryoshka campaign is most likely to discredit media outlets, public figures and fact-checking organizations targeted and to promote pro-Russia content. <br><br>With regard to these elements, VIGINUM considers that the Matryoshka campaign, which is still ongoing, constitutes a foreign digital interference.</i>

| [T0039.001 Collaborating Assets Seed and Ping](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0039.001.md) | <i>Since late 2023, VIGINUM has observed and documented a malicious campaign that could affect French-speaking public debate online. <br><br>[...]<br><br>Active on X since at least September 2023, the Matryoshka campaign is an operation conducted in two stages: <br><br>- A first group of accounts, known as “seeders”, posts fake content on the platform (see section 2.2); <br><br>- A second group of accounts, known as “quoters”, then shares a seeder’s post in response to posts by media outlets, public figures and fact-checkers (T0039.001: Collaborating Assets Seed and Ping). <br><br>The quoters contact targeted individuals or organizations to ask them to check the authenticity or veracity of content posted by the seeders (T0039.002: Solicit Production of Fact Check). Since September 2023, Matryoshka operators have conducted at least 90 successive operations, during which they adapted and tested different methods to disseminate content and bring it to the attention of their targets.<br><br>2.1.1 Content dissemination pattern<br><br>Matryoshka operations generally involve two or three seeders that initially post the content on X within a few minutes of each other. Some 30 to 40 minutes later, two or three quoters start to share the seeders’ posts, commenting on the target’s latest post. Quoters frequently add text, an emoji, or simply mention the target, this addition being unique for each operation and quoter. This second phase usually lasts several hours, with an average of 45 seconds between each quote (T0039.001: Collaborating Assets Seed and Ping).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Furthermore, the X accounts involved in the Matryoshka campaign are used to conduct several successive operations, a quoter’s account almost systematically becoming a seeder’s account and vice versa. For example, @wosuhitsu1972 was involved in at least five Matryoshka operations from 14 to 28 March 2024, in turn as a quoter, a seeder, a seeder, a quoter then a seeder (T0039.001: Collaborating Assets Seed and Ping). The account has since been suspended.<br><br>Moreover, from September 2023 to February 2024, most seeders’ and quoters’ accounts seem to have been bought from a specialized company (T0146: Account Asset, T0150.006: Purchased Asset). Some weeks before they were involved in the Matryoshka campaign, some accounts suggested in their display name that they were part of the WebMasterMarket company, which sells X accounts. They also share common features, including links with people from Asia, past creation dates, and recent posts promoting crypto assets such as Memecoin. <br><br>Created shortly before the operations (T0150.001: Newly Created Asset), all the accounts used have digitally generated profile pictures, do not mention a biography or location, and do not have any subscribers or subscriptions. As it stands, VIGINUM considers that the accounts used by Matryoshka could have been bought in different pools by the campaign, and even possibly compromised.<br><br>[...]<br><br>2.2.1 Misleading and untruthful content aimed at discrediting Ukraine and its allies <br><br>This campaign first seems to have appeared on September 5, 2023,27 with a first post sharing a report impersonating Fox News (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) and asking various media outlets to check the information (T0039.002: Solicit Production of Fact Check). <br><br>The Matryoshka campaign then primarily involved dissemination of false graffiti and posts spoofing the visual identity of Western media outlets, institutions and NGOs using the above procedure (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). To date, this content has been published in French, English, Italian, German, Russian and Ukrainian (T0101: Create Localised Content). <br><br>Matryoshka spreads three types of content impersonating media outlets, institutions and NGOs: <br><br>- Video reports with untruthful content using the visual identity and fonts of the organization (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). These false reports appear to be produced using royalty-free stock images and music;<br><br>- False screenshots presenting an excerpt of an article, an Instagram story or a short YouTube video from a media outlet (T0161.001: Impersonated Content), organization or individual (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution); <br><br>- Fake official documents impersonating a government body (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content). <br><br>Other posts involve disseminating fake images of graffiti in the streets of major Western cities (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage). These graffiti images are produced using a montage of a photograph of a real place and a caricature targeting Ukrainian or European figures. These manipulated images may also spoof the visual identity of street artists, like the French artist Lekto (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.100: Individual Persona). <br><br>The narratives pushed by these publications primarily target Ukraine and aim to discredit its government and President, or else to criticize the arrival of Ukrainian refugees in Western countries. For example, many instances of fake graffiti, often anti-Semitic, depict Volodymyr ZELENSKYY as a beggar or war criminal, and several false reports have presented Ukrainian refugees in Europe in an unfavourable light.<br><br>2.2.2 France, a key target of the Matryoshka campaign<br><br>Other narratives aim to discredit European governments, and particularly their policy supporting Ukraine. As such, France constitutes a key target for the campaign’s operators. <br><br>The media outlets BFMTV, Le Parisien, Libération, Le Monde and La Montagne (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), as well as the Banque de France, the city of Paris and the Directorate-General for Internal Security (DGSI) (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona) have been impersonated by the Matryoshka campaign. Moreover, several cases of fake graffiti (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage) purported to be situated in and around Paris. This false content targeting France spread several narratives aimed notably at sowing distrust of French institutions and government members.</i> |
