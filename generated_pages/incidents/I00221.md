The clip also includes a purported copy of a Russian passport issued in 2015 bearing the name and photo of Zelensky.<br><br>There’s no evidence for either of those claims.<br><br>New Voice of Ukraine editor-in-chief Yulia McGuffie tells BBC Verify that the clip is “a complete fake” and linked to “Russian-backed” actors.<br><br>“We have never published anything like that on any of our platforms,” she adds (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>Independent researchers told us the video is likely to be the work of a Russian disinformation campaign known as Storm-1516, which has a history of making fake videos aimed at undermining Western support for Ukraine.<br><br>Darren Linvill, a media forensics specialist at Clemson University in the US, says "there is no question this is Storm-1516".<br><br>"Russian influence campaigns have used Anonymous as a vehicle to sow lies in the past, so that is not surprising."</i> |
