# Incident I00185: Fact check: Post wrongly claims 118,000 'died suddenly' after COVID-19 vaccine release

* **Summary:** <i>The claim: CDC confirmed at least 118,000 have died suddenly since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines<br><br>[...]<br><br>The CDC has not confirmed at least 118,000 people have died suddenly since 2020, and officials say that's not an accurate description of what happened. While there have been over 100,000 excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say a majority of these deaths are related to COVID-19 infections. There is no evidence these deaths were "sudden" or linked to the COVID-19 vaccines.</i>
