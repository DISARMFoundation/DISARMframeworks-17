# Incident I00185: Fact check: Post wrongly claims 118,000 'died suddenly' after COVID-19 vaccine release

* **Summary:** <i>The claim: CDC confirmed at least 118,000 have died suddenly since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines<br><br>[...]<br><br>The CDC has not confirmed at least 118,000 people have died suddenly since 2020, and officials say that's not an accurate description of what happened. While there have been over 100,000 excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say a majority of these deaths are related to COVID-19 infections. There is no evidence these deaths were "sudden" or linked to the COVID-19 vaccines.</i>

The Instagram version generated over 4,000 likes in less than a month.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The Expose article bases its claim on data collected by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development from publicly available CDC reports. The reports calculate estimated excess deaths potentially related to the COVID-19 virus by comparing death data in pre-pandemic years to during the pandemic. <br><br>The Nov. 30, 2022, Expose article claims that data shows six-figure tallies of sudden deaths, but those are not at all the same thing as excess deaths (T0164.003: Narrative Uses Misinterpreted Statistics to Support Claim).<br><br>The CDC defines excess deaths as "the difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods."  |
