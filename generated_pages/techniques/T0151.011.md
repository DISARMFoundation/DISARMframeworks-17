**Summary**: Community Forum Platforms are made up of many Community Sub-Forums. Sub-Forums provide spaces for platform users to create a community based around any topic. <br><br>For example, Reddit (a popular Community Forum Platform) has over 138,000 “subreddits” (Community Sub-Forums), including 1082 unique cat-based communities.<br><br>Typically, Sub-Forums allow users post text, image, or video to them, and other platform users can up/downvote, or comment on it. Sub-forums may have their own extra rules alongside the platform’s global rules, enforced by community moderators. <br><br>While most Sub-Forums are made by users with Accounts on the Community Forum Platform, Sub-Forums can also be created by the platform itself.
