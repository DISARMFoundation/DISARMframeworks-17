# Technique T0164.003: Narrative Uses Misinterpreted Statistics to Support Claim

**Summary**: A claim is presented alongside valid statistics to back it up, but describes what those statistics mean incorrectly. <br><br>Examples of misinterpreting statistics include interpreting a statistical correlation as implying it demonstrates causation (for example, data shows that sale of ice cream correlates with higher levels of police response to aggression, but one doesn’t cause the other - a third element (summer heat) influences both), or ignoring contextual information about the data which influences its meaning (for example, data showing a sharp rise in umbrella sales used to evidence a new fashion trend, without noting that the period measured coincided with unusually heavy rainfall).<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts will need to review the original source for the statistics, and confirm that what they reveal has been misinterpreted to support a given claim. Analysts may contact the individual or organisation who produced the statistics and ask whether their work has been accurately characterised in the claim, or they may review the data themselves and assess themselves how well it supports the claim.

| Associated Technique | Description |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| [T0164.002 Narrative Uses Selective Statistics to Support Claim](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0164.002.md) | Misinterpreted Statistics involve drawing the wrong conclusion from accurate data (for example, confusing correlation with causation or ignoring context that changes interpretation). Selective Statistics involve choosing only the data that support a claim while omitting other relevant information. |

| [I00185 Fact check: Post wrongly claims 118,000 'died suddenly' after COVID-19 vaccine release](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00185.md) | <i>A Dec. 11, 2022, Instagram post (direct link, archived link) shows a headline purporting to report on a CDC admission.<br><br>"CDC quietly confirms at least 118k Children & Young Adults have ‘Died Suddenly’ in the USA since the roll-out of the COVID Vaccines," reads the headline from the The Expose, a website that has previously published misinformation.<br><br>The Instagram post is a screenshot of a Dec. 10, 2022, tweet that was retweeted more than 1,000 times in a month. The Instagram version generated over 4,000 likes in less than a month.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The Expose article bases its claim on data collected by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development from publicly available CDC reports. The reports calculate estimated excess deaths potentially related to the COVID-19 virus by comparing death data in pre-pandemic years to during the pandemic. <br><br>The Nov. 30, 2022, Expose article claims that data shows six-figure tallies of sudden deaths, but those are not at all the same thing as excess deaths (T0164.003: Narrative Uses Misinterpreted Statistics to Support Claim).<br><br>The CDC defines excess deaths as "the difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods."  |
| [I00187 Fact Check: False headline resurfaces to push COVID scam conspiracy](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00187.md) | <i>An inaccurate article has resurfaced on social media to wrongly suggest 99% of COVID-19 deaths were primarily caused by something other than the virus (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>Social media posts shared a screenshot of a long-since corrected Mail Online headline about weekly COVID fatalities in the U.S.<br><br>“99% of 'Covid deaths' not primarily caused by the virus, CDC data shows,” said the headline in the screenshot, referring to figures published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the week ending Aug. 19, 2023.<br><br>The posts suggested the screenshot was evidence the COVID pandemic was a scam.<br><br>“We, the allegedly dangerous conspiracy theorists, were right from the start. The measures were deadly, not the common cold itself,” said one Dec. 10, 2024, post sharing the screenshot on X, which received more than 315,000 views.<br><br>However, the original article and its headline misrepresented the CDC data (T0164.003: Narrative Uses Misinterpreted Statistics to Support Claim), which initially indicated 1.7% of total U.S. deaths in the week to Aug. 19, 2023, were primarily due to COVID.<br><br>The article, published on Aug. 28, 2023, interpreted the data as showing deaths where COVID was the primary cause as a percentage of all COVID-linked deaths.<br><br>The Mail Online updated the article on Aug. 29, 2023, with a new headline that said: “Covid to blame for just 1% of weekly deaths from all causes across the US, CDC data shows.”<br><br>At the bottom of the article, it said: “An earlier version of this article claimed 99 percent of Covid deaths in the past week were not primarily caused by the virus. In fact, a footnote at the bottom of the CDC's Covid data tracker explains the percentage of all reported deaths attributed as Covid-19 is calculated based on the number of deaths from all causes. We have amended the article to reflect this.”<br><br>[...]<br><br>The CDC data showed 1.7% of all deaths - later updated to 1.6% - were primarily caused by COVID, not that 99% of COVID-related deaths were caused by something other than the virus. The Mail Online corrected its headline in 2023.</i> |
| [I00188 Fact check: CDC's data on COVID-19 deaths used incorrectly in misleading claims](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00188.md) | <i>The claim: Only 6% of reported COVID-19 deaths were the result of the coronavirus<br><br>A regular update of data on COVID-19 deaths by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has prompted a groundswell of claims that only a fraction of people have actually died directly from the novel coronavirus.<br><br>The misleading and inaccurate conclusions come from recently released statistics on comorbidities data in the CDC's weekly coronavirus update, with statistics as of Aug. 26 (T0164.003: Narrative Uses Misinterpreted Statistics to Support Claim).<br><br>“For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death,” the report reads.<br><br>The data, which is maintained by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, is an aggregated list of comorbidities on death certificates reported to the agency.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The CDC defines a comorbidity as when “more than one disease or condition is present in the same person at the same time.” A comorbidity is often a chronic condition that a person can live with, such as arthritis, diabetes or obesity.<br><br>When a person dies, the cause and manner of death of death are determined separately from any comorbidities that may have been present. A person who takes his own life, for instance, has suicide listed for a cause of death, with any comorbidities he may have had documented separately.<br><br>The CDC regularly records comorbidities data for a range of diseases affecting Americans, including cancer and opioid overdoses.<br><br>As with COVID-19, it is possible that a person’s preexisting conditions exacerbated his or her death in the case of a drug overdose, for instance, but it is inaccurate to say the main cause of death was not the overdose itself.<br><br>“It seems clear that comorbidities, leading to compromised immune systems, play an important role in COVID-19 deaths, and in such cases attributing deaths to a single cause is at best questionable,” Roderick Little, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Michigan, told USA TODAY.<br><br>[...]<br><br>“These data come from death certificates, and the death certificate is designed to only capture information on causes of death,” Anderson said, explaining that COVID-19 would then not be "an incidental or trivial factor."<br><br>"The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person’s death," Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications at the National Center for Health Statistics, told PolitiFact.<br><br>"In 92% of all deaths that mention COVID-19, COVID-19 is listed as the underlying cause of death," Lancashire said.</i> |
