# Technique T0163.003: Narrative Cites Retracted Academic Research

**Summary**: Academic research can be retracted in cases where issues with the report are uncovered, including errors with how the research was conducted, corruption on behalf of the researchers, fake peer reviews, or publishing multiple papers based on the same data. Research such as this which has been retracted is sometimes still used to support claims, without acknowledging the results are not valid.<br><br>To count as a citation, the content must explicitly point to a specific piece of academic research to support a claim. This could be via an embedded link, footnotes, or providing the name of a paper, the journal it appears in, and the researchers who produced it.<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts need to identify the cited article, and confirm that it has been discredited. They may do this by searching for retracted academic research on publicly available databases such as (Retraction Watch,)[https://retractionwatch.com/retraction-watch-database-user-guide/] or by contacting the publishing journal.

| [I00174 Academic journals, journalists perpetuate misinformation in their handling of research retractions, a new study finds](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00174.md) | <i>Journals can take months to years to retract unreliable research while journalists often fail to inform the public when the scientific discoveries they have reported on are later determined invalid or fraudulent.<br><br>The analysis reveals researchers play a role, too. Some researchers rely on and use discredited research in their work (T0163.003: Narrative Cites Retracted Academic Research) — even years after a journal has withdrawn the research from publication because problems such as scientific misconduct, significant errors, plagiarism or ethics violations have rendered those results untrustworthy.<br><br>Lead author Stylianos “Stelios” Serghiou explained the new study highlights key problems in the pipeline for communicating science to the public. In an email interview, he stressed the need to correct the scientific record as well as the public record following a retraction, “especially in the case of consequential or highly popularized articles.”<br><br>“When highly popularized research is retracted, we need to consider the obligation to inform the public that this research is no longer considered credible by the scientific community,” Serghiou, who has a medical degree and completed a doctoral degree in epidemiology and clinical research at Stanford University last year, wrote to The Journalist’s Resource.<br><br>The best way to do that, though, is unclear, Serghiou and his colleagues explain in their new paper. When they looked at how people discussed a small sample of retractions on social media, they discovered that, in some cases, “retraction was directly or indirectly associated with the promotion of the initial misinformation.”<br><br>Even though thousands of papers have been retracted over time, they remain rare. About 4 in 10,000 papers are retracted, Science magazine reported in 2018. Retraction Watch, a project of the nonprofit Center for Scientific Integrity, tracks retractions and has built a database of more than 26,000 retractions going back to 1756.<br><br>[...]<br><br>- Most papers and their retractions tend to draw similar amounts of attention from news outlets, social media and other sources. But the most popular papers received 2.5 times as much attention before they were retracted than afterward.<br><br>- A median 457 days passed between a paper’s publication and its retraction.<br><br>- Of the retracted papers examined, 31 were cited more than 100 times each in other research.<br><br>- The most common reason for retraction during the study period was duplication, when a researcher or group of researchers publish the same information in two different papers. The second most common was “fake peer review,” meaning the authors cheated — intentionally or unintentionally — the peer-review process through which scholars vet and evaluate one another’s work. Plagiarism was the third most common reason.<br><br>- Tumor Biology had the largest retraction during the study period. In 2017, the journal published a retraction note withdrawing 103 articles due to fake peer review.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Serghiou explained that journalists should report on retractions to correct the public record, but it’s unclear the best way to do that. He told JR there could be unintended consequences when journalists correct the record — potentially spurring social media users to promote the retracted findings as valid.<br><br>One retracted paper they studied, published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2012, claimed that putting an Elmo sticker on an apple encouraged children to choose apples over cookies. Before its retraction, people tweeted about the paper four times. The retraction, Serghiou noted, led to a flurry of tweets promoting the invalid finding. Someone tweeted a sentence suggesting stickers make children choose fruit over cookies and it was retweeted 742 times (T0163.003: Narrative Cites Retracted Academic Research).<br><br>“In our limited study of tweets about recent popular retracted articles, we were very surprised to witness that retraction without appropriate communication may lead to inadvertent promotion of the results being retracted,” Serghiou wrote to JR.</i> |
| [I00175 Many scientists citing two scandalous COVID-19 papers ignore their retractions](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00175.md) | <i>In June 2020, in the biggest research scandal of the pandemic so far, two of the most important medical journals each retracted a high-profile study of COVID-19 patients. Thousands of news articles, tweets, and scholarly commentaries highlighted the scandal, yet many researchers apparently failed to notice. In an examination of the most recent 200 academic articles published in 2020 that cite those papers, Science found that more than half—including many in leading journals—used the disgraced papers to support scientific findings and failed to note the retractions.<br><br>COVID-19 "is such a hot topic that publishers are willing to publish without proper vetting," even in the face of retractions that made global headlines, says Elizabeth Suelzer, a reference librarian at the Medical College of Wisconsin who has written about problematic citations to a retracted 1998 study in The Lancet falsely linking vaccination to autism.<br><br>Both of the retracted COVID-19 papers, one in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the other in The Lancet, were based on what appeared to be a huge database of patient records compiled from hospitals worldwide by Surgisphere, a small company operated by vascular surgeon Sapan Desai, who was a co-author on each article. The 22 May 2020 Lancet paper ostensibly showed that hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug promoted by President Donald Trump and others, could harm rather than help COVID-19 patients. Its publication led to a temporary halt in a major clinical trial and inflamed an already-divisive debate over the drug, which has proved to be no help against COVID-19. The 1 May NEJM article corroborated other evidence that people already taking certain blood pressure medicines did not face a greater risk of death if they developed COVID-19.<br><br>Questions soon arose about the validity, and even existence, of the Surgisphere database, however, and the retractions followed on 4 June. But of the 200 papers examined by Science—all published after the retractions—105 inappropriately cited one of the disgraced studies (T0163.003: Narrative Cites Retracted Academic Research). In several cases it was a primary source for a meta-analysis combining multiple studies to draw overarching conclusions. In most, the studies were cited as scientific support or context. Science also found a handful of articles that uncritically cited an influential April preprint (T0163.004: Narrative Cites Academic Research not Peer Reviewed) based on the same Surgisphere data set, which described the antiparasitic drug ivermectin as beneficial in critical COVID-19 cases. (There is no standard way to retract preprints, however.)<br><br>Ivan Oransky, co-founder of the website Retraction Watch, says such blunders occur because "people are either willfully or negligently not checking references." Many authors copy and paste lists of apparently relevant citations from similar papers without actually reading them, he says. "It's frightening. It's terrible, but common."</i> |
