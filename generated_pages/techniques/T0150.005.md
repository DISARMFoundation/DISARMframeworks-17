| Associated Technique | Description |

| [T0145.005 Illustrated Character Account Imagery](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0145.005.md) | A Compromised Persona can only exist on a Compromised Asset which previously housed an Authentic Persona. However, Assets which are Compromised are not always used to take action under a Compromised Persona. Sometimes Compromised Assets are taken and rebranded as a new Inauthentic Persona, because their activity is less likely to be flagged by automated moderation systems as suspicious compared to Newly Created Assets. |
