# Technique T0039.002: Solicit Production of Fact Check

**Summary**: An asset has asked another asset to check the veracity of a claim or content published online.<br><br>While it’s natural and desired for users who authentically encounter claims or content they are unsure about to ask for support checking their veracity, threat actors have been observed posting campaign content with one asset, and using another to ask media organisations to confirm the content’s veracity (with the presumed objective of boosting its visibility, or tying up the organisation’s resources).<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts need to observe an asset (e.g. an account, a page) requesting another asset (usually a fact checking organisation, news outlet, or other media organisation) to confirm the veracity of something they have seen. This could be a claim or piece of content they provide, or a link to another source which hosts a claim or content.<br><br>This Technique by itself is not indicative of malicious behaviour, but can help understand campaign actions or objectives when observed in assets attributed to a threat actor.

The official media don't talk about it, what am I supposed to believe?" she asks.<br><br>Within a few hours, this profile attracted the attention of dozens of French media outlets such as Le Progrès, Paris Match, Mediapart, Le Point, Franceinfo, Le Figaro, RFI, Le Parisien...<br><br>The account then remained inactive until December 20: it then posted a graffiti of Zelensky caricatured as a homeless person in Los Angeles, an image that another account would in turn ask media outlets to verify, and so on (T0039.001: Collaborating Assets Seed and Ping).<br><br>The videos that need to be verified are, in the vast majority of cases, mimicking the style of major French and international media outlets (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). [...] <br><br>The data provided by "Antibot4Navalny," which AFP investigated, documents the existence of dozens, if not hundreds, of profiles using this strategy of mass media harassment. Most of these are accounts abandoned by their owners and then hacked (T0150.005: Compromised Asset). A sign that these accounts have been taken over by bots is that posts sometimes appear at a rate of one per minute, effectively flooding social media. <br><br>AFP's analysis also revealed that accounts that ask media outlets to verify fake news will themselves spread it some time later.<br><br>Misappropriation of military aid to Ukraine, truncated or invented Zelensky graffiti (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage) and fake advertisements on Times Square: these publications always implicate Ukrainians and seek to stir up the idea of  |
