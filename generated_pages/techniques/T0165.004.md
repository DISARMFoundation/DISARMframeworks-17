# Technique T0165.004: Source Edited Out of Content

**Summary**: When people publish content they created, they sometimes include ‘watermarks’ or other identifiers to help people find them if their content is reposted, and to be credited for their work. This sub-technique can be used to assert that a piece of content has been edited to remove references to the original source without disclosure.<br><br>Examples include editing videos or images to superimpose material over a watermark or logo, cropping out a watermark or logo, clipping sections of audio or video revealing the source, taking an article’s text and removing its byline.<br><br>To make this assessment, analysts will need to find the original unedited content, identify elements which help consumers of the content identify its source which do not appear in content published by the actor.
