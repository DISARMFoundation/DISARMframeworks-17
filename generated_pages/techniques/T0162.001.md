# Technique T0162.001: Incorrect Subtitled Speech Reframes Context

**Summary**: Subtitles added to content to support viewers in understanding what was said by an individual can misrepresent what was said, which is difficult for viewers to detect when watching a speaker of another language, or videos without an audio track.<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts need to confirm that what was said was meaningfully different to the subtitles provided for the speech (i.e. not nit-picking minor translation issues, but changes which make changes to the context of what was said).<br><br>Analysts may require bilingual speakers to identify mistranslations. They can also search for the original media to search for original subtitles.

| [I00064 Tinder nightmares: the promise and peril of political bots](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00064.md) | <i>In the days leading up to the UK’s general election (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), youths looking for love online encountered a whole new kind of Tinder nightmare. A group of young activists built a Tinder chatbot to co-opt profiles and persuade swing voters to support Labour. The bot accounts sent 30,000-40,000 messages to targeted 18-25 year olds in battleground constituencies like Dudley North, which Labour ended up winning by only 22 votes.<br><br>The tactic was frankly ingenious. Tinder is a dating app where users swipe right to indicate attraction and interest in a potential partner. If both people swipe right on each other’s profile, a dialogue box becomes available for them to privately chat. After meeting their crowdfunding goal of only £500, the team built a tool which took over and operated the accounts of recruited Tinder-users. By upgrading the profiles to Tinder Premium, the team was able to place bots in any contested constituency across the UK (T0097.101: Local Persona). Once planted, the bots swiped right on all users in the attempt to get the largest number of matches and inquire into their voting intentions.<br><br>Yara Rodrigues Fowler and Charlotte Goodman, the two campaigners leading the informal GE Tinder Bot team, explained in a recent opinion piece that if “the user was voting for a right-wing party or was unsure, the bot sent a list of Labour policies, or a criticism of Tory policies,” (T0136.006: Cultivate Support for Ally) with the aim “of getting voters to help oust the Conservative government.”<br><br>Pieces in major media outlets like the New York Times and BBC have applauded these digital canvassers for their ingenuity and civic service. But upon closer inspection, the project reveals itself to be ethically dubious and problematic on a number of levels. How would these same outlets respond if such tactics were used to support the Tories? And what does this mean for the use of bots and other political algorithms in the future?<br><br>The activists maintain that the project was meant to foster democratic engagement. But screenshots of the bots’ activity expose a harsher reality. Images of conversations between real users and these bots, posted on i-D, Mashable, as well as on Fowler and Goodman’s public Twitter accounts, show that the bots did not identify themselves as automated accounts, instead posing as the user whose profile they had taken over (T0146.007: Automated Account Asset, T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0145.005: Compromised Persona, T0097.109: Romantic Suitor Persona). While conducting research for this story, it turned out that a number of our friends living in Oxford had interacted with the bot in the lead up to the election and had no idea that it was not a real person.</i> |
| [I00066 The online war between Qatar and Saudi Arabia](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00066.md) | <i>In the early hours of 24 May 2017, a news story appeared on the website of Qatar's official news agency, QNA, reporting that the country's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, had made an astonishing speech (T0152.004: Website Asset, T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0145.005: Compromised Persona).<br><br>The quotes then appeared on the QNA's social media accounts (T0146: Account Asset, T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0145.005: Compromised Persona) and on the news ticker running along the bottom of the screen on videos uploaded to the agency's YouTube channel (T0162.002: Edits Made to News Report which Reframe Context).<br><br>The emir was quoted praising Islamist groups Hamas, Hezbollah and the Muslim Brotherhood. And perhaps most controversially of all, Iran, Saudi Arabia's arch-rival (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>But the story soon disappeared from the QNA website, and Qatar's foreign ministry issued a statement denying the speech had ever taken place. No video footage has ever emerged of the emir actually saying the words supposedly attributed to him.<br><br>Qatar claimed that the QNA had been hacked. And they said the hack was designed to deliberately spread fake news about the country's leader and its foreign policies. The Qataris specifically blamed UAE, an allegation later repeated by a Washington Post report which cited US intelligence sources. The UAE categorically denied those reports.<br><br>But the story of the emir's speech unleashed a media free-for-all. Within minutes, Saudi and UAE-owned TV networks - Al Arabiya and Sky News Arabia - picked up on the comments attributed to al-Thani. Both networks accused Qatar of funding extremist groups and of destabilising the region.</i> |
| [I00071 Russia-aligned hacktivists stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiments in Poland](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00071.md) | <i>On August 16, 2022, pro-Kremlin Telegram channel Joker DPR (Джокер ДНР) published a forged letter allegedly written by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.111: Government Official Persona). In the letter, Kuleba supposedly asked relevant Polish authorities to rename Belwederska Street in Warsaw — the location of the Russian embassy building — as Stepan Bandera Street, in honor of the far-right nationalist who led the Ukrainian Insurgent Army during WWII.<br><br>More than sixty years after his death, Bandera remains a polarizing figure. While still highly regarded in far-right Ukrainian nationalist circles, he is largely remembered for his role in the massacres of Polish civilians and collaborating with Nazi officials. In Russia, the word Banderite has become synonymous with “fascist” or even “Nazi.” During the early months of the war in Ukraine, Kremlin propaganda spoke of “de-nazifying” Ukraine and removing its democratically elected government, which it referred to contemptuously as “Banderite.”<br><br>The forged letter claimed that renaming the street after Bandera would be seen as a gesture of support to Ukraine, and highlighted that Russia changed the names of the streets in Moscow where the US and UK embassies are located. The letter is not dated, and Dmytro Kuleba’s signature seems to be copied from a publicly available letter signed by him in 2021.<br><br>The day after releasing the letter, Joker DPR published another document on Telegram, allegedly signed by Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.111: Government Official Persona). The document contained several orders supposedly issued by Przydacz, including an order for the President of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance to provide a written expert opinion by August 31 about the possibility of changing the street in Warsaw to Stepan Bandera Street. It also proposed to conduct a publicity campaign to improve Bandera’s popularity among Polish citizens, despite his role in WWII-era Polish massacres.<br><br>Deputy Foreign Minister Przydac wrote on Twitter that the document published under his name was forged and that no one at the Polish Foreign Ministry had written such a letter. “It’s a fake,” he tweeted. “Never would such a magazine be created by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The linguistic errors clearly point to the potential authors of this provocation.”<br><br>The August 17 Telegram post also contained screenshots of Facebook posts that appeared on two Facebook accounts belonging to Polish nationals Piotr Górka, an expert in the history of the Polish Air Force, and Dariusz Walusiak, a Polish historian and documentary maker. The Górka post suggested that he fully supported the Polish government’s decision to change Belwederska Street to Stepan Bandera Street.<br><br>In a statement to the DFRLab, Górka said his account was accessed without his consent (T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0145.005: Compromised Persona, T0097.101: Local Persona, T0097.108: Expert Persona). “This is not my post loaded to my Facebook page, (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)” he explained. “My site was hacked, some days ago.” At the time of publishing, Piotr Górka’s post and his Facebook account were no longer accessible.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The fact that Joker DPR’s Telegram post included screenshots of their Facebook posts raises the strong possibility that both Facebook accounts were compromised, and that hackers planted false statements on their pages that would seem out of character for them in order to gain further attention to the forged documents (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).</i> |
| [I00129 Teen who hacked Joe Biden and Bill Gates' Twitter accounts sentenced to three years in prison](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00129.md) | <i>An 18-year-old hacker who pulled off a huge breach in 2020, infiltrating several high profile Twitter accounts to solicit bitcoin transactions, has agreed to serve three years in prison for his actions.<br><br>Graham Ivan Clark, of Florida, was 17 years old at the time of the hack in July, during which he took over a number of major accounts including those of Joe Biden, Bill Gates and Kim Kardashian West.<br><br>Once he accessed them, Clark tweeted a link to a bitcoin address and wrote “all bitcoin sent to our address below will be sent back to you doubled!” (T0146.003: Verified Account Asset, T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0145.005: Compromised Persona, T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution) According to court documents, Clark made more than $100,000 from the scheme, which his lawyers say he has since returned.<br><br>Clark was able to access the accounts after convincing an employee at Twitter he worked in the company’s information technology department, according to the Tampa Bay Times.<br><br>The incident represented a major security breach for the social network, which was forced to suspend all verified accounts from sending tweets for several hours while it worked to secure the platform. Clark, who was at the time a senior in high school, was arrested several days later.</i> |
| [I00130 Images of a ‘Palestinian girl’ being rescued were taken in Syria in 2016](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00130.md) | <i>Posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) sharing images of a girl being rescued claim: “This Palestinian girl is saved by 3 different people from 3 different locations on 3 different days and all locations are 50 KM apart from each other. Wondering why she keeps travelling so far especially in the conflict zone?”<br><br>It’s not entirely clear what these posts are suggesting. We have not seen any reports that could misleadingly suggest the same Palestinian girl has been rescued on three separate occasions. And if we take the posts literally, they are not true, because we can say for certain that these images come from Aleppo, Syria (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location), in the aftermath of a bombing that took place on 27 August 2016 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current).<br><br>They do not come from the current conflict in Israel and Gaza, and do not show rescues taking place in Gaza.<br><br>Reverse image searches of each photo show that they were all taken on the same day, at the same location, and show the same girl being passed between different rescuers (T0162: Reframe Context).<br><br>The first photo featured in coverage of the Aleppo bombing by the Daily Mail and The Sun. The second featured in reports on the same bombing by NBC News, while the third was published alongside a report on the bombing by Arab Times, and also appears in an ABC News report on the impact of the war in Syria on children, with a caption stating that it was taken at the 27 August 2016 bombing.<br><br>Social media posts about these images were previously fact checked by Snopes in 2016 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked), and Africa Check in 2019 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked) after it was claimed that CNN had used them to illustrate three different refugee crises.</i> |
| [I00131 Video shows scenes in Algiers, not bombing in Gaza](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00131.md) | <i>A viral video is being shared on social media with the claim it shows the Gaza Strip following the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas. But it actually comes from Algiers (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location) and predates events in October 2023 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current). The clip is likely to actually show celebrations from football fans (T0162: Reframe Context).<br><br>The video shows a skyline illuminated in red with thousands of small fires and the sound of explosions. It has been shared across social media platforms, including Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok with the claim it shows the Gaza Strip.<br><br>Multiple posts have the caption: “If Russia did this in Kiev it would be all over the news and everyone would be screaming "genocide", but it's happening in Gaza and no one cares about the civilian casualties.” Another post claims it is an “old video from Gaza”. <br><br>However, the video does not show either current or past events in the Gaza Strip (T0160.002: Information is False). The lights and explosions appear to be fireworks and flares.<br><br>Journalists at Bellingcat located the clip to Algiers using a roundabout and billboard that can be seen in the background of the footage, which has also been verified by fact checkers at Reuters. The video was also reportedly first posted to TikTok on 28 September—but has since been deleted—and was reshared on YouTube that same day, predating the recent conflict that began on 7 October. <br><br>While the specific context of the clip is not absolutely clear, footage showing similar scenes was posted online on 8 August 2023 in celebration of the 102nd anniversary of Algiers-based football club Mouloudia Alger. There are several other videos showing Algerian football fans celebrating with bright red fireworks on many different occasions dating as far back as 2014.</i> |
| [I00132 Video of ‘corpse running away’ is not related to Israel conflict](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00132.md) | <i>A video of an apparent funeral procession where what appears to be a corpse suddenly runs away when an alarm rings out is being shared with a misleading claim that it shows people “scared of Israel’s drones”.<br><br>During the video, a group appear to be carrying a shrouded body, which they put down and run away from when a siren sounds. The ‘dead body’ then also gets up and runs off, to laughter from the person filming.<br><br>The footage has been shared with the caption: “Even dead are scared of Israel’s Drones [sic].” That suggests the video shows people being targeted by Israeli drones, possibly in Gaza or Lebanon given current events in the Middle East. But this is not the case (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>The video was actually filmed in Jordan (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location) in 2020 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current), during the Covid-19 pandemic. It was reported by an Arabic-language news channel on 25 March 2020, and the same video was also published on Facebook on 23 March 2020 by a Jordanian news outlet.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Although we’ve not been able to verify for certain what the video shows, it was filmed in the early days of the pandemic when strict Covid-19 rules were in place. Lockdown restrictions were implemented nationwide in Jordan in March 2020, which included an army-enforced curfew and closures of borders with neighbouring countries.<br><br>The fact that the video includes a supposed corpse moving also appears to echo a narrative, often referred to as ‘Pallywood’ (a portmanteau of Palestine and Bollywood), which is used by some online to describe the alleged false staging of harm to Palestinian civilians (T0162: Reframe Context). <br><br>Full Fact has debunked a number of videos and photos that were posted with misleading claims they showed Palestinians pretending to be dead or injured during the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict.<br><br>This video has been previously debunked by other fact checking organisations (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked), when it was claimed to show various different instances of Palestinians faking injuries, as far back as 2021.</i> |
| [I00133 ‘Dead Gazan body miraculously texting’ is actually Thai child in Halloween costume](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00133.md) | <i>Multiple images shared on social media appear to show a child wearing a body bag using a phone, with captions falsely (T0160.002: Information is False) suggesting the person is in Gaza (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location) and has been pretending to be dead for the cameras (T0162: Reframe Context). <br><br>Posts sharing the photo make claims such as: “One of the Gazans killed brutally by #Israel is texting from another world. #Gaza in need of actors”. Another claims the picture shows “a ‘dead’ Gazan body miraculously texting”.<br><br>But the image was not taken recently (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current), or in Gaza (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location). The first example we could find of the image was posted on Facebook in October 2022 by a mother who dressed her children up for a Halloween costume contest in Thailand. Other images of the child show them in their full costume, including a cardboard coffin. The post has over 21,000 shares.<br><br>The pictures were published by multiple Thai-language outlets, which describe (translated by Google) that the child in the white shroud did not place in the competition, but that their sibling came third.<br><br>Some of the posts claiming the picture shows a Gazan “actor” mention the word “Pallywood” or “Palliwood”. This is a portmanteau of Palestine and Bollywood, first coined over a decade ago by historian Richard Landes to describe what he claims as the “staging of scenes by Palestinian journalists in order to present the Palestinians as hapless victims of Israeli aggression”.<br><br>The term has recently seen a resurgence online to caption videos often incorrectly claiming to show a concerted effort by those in Gaza to fake images of harm to civilians as part of the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza. We’ve seen such captions on AI-generated images of people in Gaza, miscaptioned photos from other places, or videos falsely claiming to show actors pretending to be dead or injured. <br><br>It’s not always clear how these images came to be misrepresented, who was responsible and whether this was done on purpose rather than inadvertently.</i> |
| [I00134 Video does not show Palestinians pretending to be dead](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00134.md) | <i>A video circulating on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) showing a row of people lying under what appear to be shrouds, while occasionally moving, has been shared alongside captions suggesting these are Palestinians pretending to have died in the recent Israel-Gaza conflict.<br><br>However this footage is actually from a 2013 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current) student protest (T0162: Reframe Context) in Cairo, Egypt (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location).<br><br>In the video, the camera pans over multiple people lying in a row under what appear to be white shrouds, which have messages written on them in Arabic. Over the course of the video, multiple people can be seen to move under the shrouds. Someone off-camera removes the cloth from the face of a man who appears to laugh. <br><br>The text of the video shared on Facebook says “Wake up world/They think you are fools! The masters of fake news/ Welcome the palestinians [sic] & their Hamas” (T0162: Reframe Context), while the caption states “Dude, stop moving” and is accompanied by the hashtags “#standwithisrael”, “HamasisISIS” and “pallywood”. (T0015.001: Use Existing Hashtag)<br><br>This latter phrase is a portmanteau of Palestine and Bollywood used by some to describe the alleged false staging of images or videos to portray Palestinian victimhood. Full Fact has written about this term before after it was included in several misleading posts online. <br><br>This video was not taken recently (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current), or in Gaza or the West Bank (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location), and does not show Palestinians. <br><br>The watermark in the top right corner of the video says ‘Al-Badil’ in Arabic, which was an Egyptian news service. The same video and watermark is evident in this original version of the video, which was uploaded to the organisation’s YouTube channel on 28 October 2013. <br><br>The caption (translated with Google) says the video shows Muslim Brotherhood students at Al-Azhar University in Cairo. In October 2013, students at the university undertook multiple protests, demanding the reinstatement of Mohammed Morsi as President of Egypt after he was deposed by the military in July 2013. <br><br>This video has been used multiple times to falsely claim (T0160.002: Information is False) that deaths are being staged in various conflicts (T0162: Reframe Context): in 2016, the title of this video suggests the people are “victims” of “Russian bombings” faking their deaths; in 2017 and 2018 social media posts suggested this video showed apparent “Victims of [Syrian President] Assad’s chemical attack” or “living corpses in Syria after the poison gas attack”; and in 2021 it was claimed that the video showed Palestinians “posing” as “corpses” (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked).</i> |

AFP's bureau in Vietnam confirmed the name of the deceased on the screen did not belong to Hsu. <br><br>Subsequent Google reverse image searches led to similar footage posted on TikTok on December 30, 2024 by a user who identifies himself as Pham Son Hai and a worker at the Hoa Lac Vien crematorium in Vietnam (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location). <br><br>It contains several elements seen in the false video, including the television screen, the cremation chamber number, the casket design and the yellow statuette on the table. <br><br>When shown the circulating Facebook video, Pham told AFP on February 11: "The user posted the wrong thing.

Demanding that Singh be arrested, the wrestlers have asked for support from farmers, and other groups.

One such video on Twitter showing tractors with Indian flags was shared as part of the wrestlers' ongoing protest. The post's caption read: "Walk to Delhi with a tractor to get justice for your daughters," and tagged women wrestlers Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat. This post received over 4,000 views.

| [I00160 Did Ruth Bader Ginsburg Say that Pedophilia Was Good for Children?](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00160.md) | <i>The language in a 1974 report that was co-authored by Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has been analyzed and criticized for more than four decades. The piece tackled sex bias in the United States penal code. As these critics have devolved from scholars, to senators, to pundits, to conspiracy-minded web sites, to the lowly meme maker, the accusations against Ginsburg have grown more crude and distorted.<br><br>In February 2018, for instance, we came across a meme featuring an image of the Supreme Court Justice and a quote ostensibly uttered by her about pedophilia being good for children:<br><br>This is not a genuine quote from Ruth Bader Ginsburg (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>This claim is based upon a gross misinterpretation of another misinterpretation, which was itself based upon a simple misreading of a 1974 report entitled "The Legal Status of Women Under Federal Law" that was co-authored by Ginsburg, who at the time was a professor of law at the Columbia Law School. The other co-author was Brenda Feigen-Fasteau, a former director of the American Civil Liberties Union's women's rights project.<br><br>In 1974 Ginsburg and Feigen-Fasteau published a report examining how federal law frequently employed gendered language. This report was used as the basis for the "Sex Bias in the U.S. Code," a report published in 1977, which included a passage explaining the purpose of the study:<br><br>The Constitution, which provides the framework for the American legal system, was drafted using the generic term "man." While the United States Supreme Court, the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, might have determined that "man" also means "woman" in terms of rights, duties, privileges, and obligations under the Constitution, the Court instead has chosen on numerous occasions to deny to women certain rights and privileges not denied to men.<br><br>While explaining the "equality principle" and arguing that pronouns should be altered in the existing penal code so that both men and women were equally accountable for crimes against both boys and girls, Ginsburg quoted a proposed 1973 Senate bill as an example of legislation which used gender neutral language:<br><br>A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person, not his spouse, and (1) compels the other person to participate: (A) by force or (B) by threatening or placing the other person in fear that any person will imminently be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; (2) has substantially impaired the other person's power to appraise or control the conduct by administering or employing a drug or intoxicant without the knowledge or against the will of such other person, or by other means; or (3) the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old.<br><br>It is the highlighted line that has been repeatedly misinterpreted and distorted over the ensuing decades.<br><br>It appears that Ginsburg was first accused of wanting to lower the age of consent to 12 shortly before she was confirmed to the Supreme Court in 1993. This accusation reemerged in 2005 after John Roberts was nominated. Both Senator Lindsey Graham and Fox News host Sean Hannity, for instance, used this line to argue that Ginsburg was "very left-wing" and immoral:<br><br>HANNITY: I guess where I am on this, if you look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I mean, she -- the Ginsburg rule, she doesn't have to answer specific questions, clearly pro-choice going in, thinks there may even be a constitutional right to polygamy, has a controversial view we should lower the age of consent to 12, supports legalized prostitution, very left-wing.<br><br>GRAHAM: Well, there are all kind of hearts. There are bleeding hearts and there are hard hearts. And if I wanted to judge Justice Ginsburg on her heart, I might take a hard-hearted view of her and say she's a bleeding heart. She represents the ACLU. She wants the age of consent to be 12. She believes there's a constitutional right to prostitution. What kind of heart is that?<br><br>However, Ginsburg never actually said that the age of consent should be lowered to 12 (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>Ginsburg's report was about changing gendered language, not the age of consent, in our existing laws. In the quoted passage, she was not arguing for or against lowering the age of consent; rather, she was quoting a proposed Senate bill as an example of how appropriate gender-neutral pronouns should be used. Ginsburg wrote that she used this bill because it "conform(ed) to the equality principle," not because she agreed with the presented age of consent.<br><br>Furthermore, Ginsburg mentioned another section of the penal code a few paragraphs earlier which referenced a different age of consent: 16. In both cases, Ginsburg's focus was on the gender of the victim, rather than the age, as her report was specifically concerned with gendered-language in U.S. law:<br><br>18 U.S.C. § §1154 and 2032 make it a crime for a person to have carnal knowledge of a female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of sixteen years.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The "statutory rape" offense defined in these sections follows the traditional pattern: the victim must be a female and the offender, a male. Protection of the girl's virtue as an asset to be traded by her family at marriage time can no longer survive as a justification for such provisions. The immaturity and vulnerability of young people of both sexes can be protected through appropriately drawn, sex-neutral proscriptions.<br><br>The claim that Ginsburg said that "pedophilia was good for children" appears to be the result of a decades-long game of telephone that started with a misreading of a 1974 report.<br><br>It started in 1993, after Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court, when this report was quoted out of context as evidence that Ginsburg wanted to lower the age of consent to 12 (T0162.009: Statement Reframed by Removal from Context). As this errant argument was reiterated by pundits such as Sean Hannity it morphed from a single out of context quote to an alleged personal belief at the core of Ginsburg's political views. When the "Pizzagate" controversy exploded during the 2016 presidential election, this rumor underwent another devolution as conspiracy theorists claimed that Ginsburg once wrote that she wanted to legalize child rape.</i> |
| [I00161 Pro-Kremlin Telegram channels promote narrative that Poland will annex western Ukraine](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00161.md) | <i>Pro-Kremlin Telegram channels continue speculating on alleged Polish aspirations to annex parts of western Ukraine. Previously, channels and other sources published a falsified letter to “confirm” this theory. A new round of disinformation continues this campaign in an apparent attempt to discredit the Polish Army and drive a wedge between Poland and Ukraine.<br><br>The Russian Telegram channel Signal published forged photos of multiple billboards (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage) depicting Jarosław Mika, General Commander of Branches of the Polish Armed Forces, alongside the quote, “It’s time to remember history,” a reference to the historical fact that parts of western Ukraine were once Polish territory . The channel also mentioned the removal of Ukrainian flags from Polish public transportation, as well as a previous statement by Sergei Naryshkin, the chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, claiming the US and Poland were plotting to partition Ukraine. While the flag removal and Naryshkin’s statement both occurred, the channel claimed without evidence that Poland was about to invade Ukraine, using the forged billboards as additional evidence. Polish outlet Konkret24 was the first to confirm the billboard images had been forged.<br><br>The fake billboard story was later amplified by the Kremlin-tied Telegram channel Gossip Girl, which had previously published the forged letter alleging Poland’s intent to annex Ukrainian territory ( T0151.007: Chat Broadcast Group). “So what does Poland really want?” Gossip Girl asked. “Help secure western Ukraine by sending in troops or regain historical lands?”<br><br>Another Kremlin-tied channel, Legitimniy (“Legitimate”), forwarded the forged billboard images and claimed, “Poland is preparing for expansion, many factors indicate this, but no one will tell Ukrainians about this.” The channel also discussed that Poland might attempt to censor Ukrainian history, ironically reflecting what Kremlin is actually doing.<br><br>On May 3, Telegram channel Rokot|Ryk, which uses the Russian pro-invasion Z symbol in its logo, published a short clip of a speech by Polish President Andrzej Duda in which he said that there wouldn’t be any borders between Poland and Ukraine. In its original context, President Duda’s quote was in reference to a new era of Ukraine-Poland cooperation and opposition to Russian imperialism and its occupation of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. Presented out of context, though, the Telegram post misleadingly implied that President Duda was discussing the “inclusion” of Ukraine within Polish territory (T0162.009: Statement Reframed by Removal from Context, T0162.008: Context Reframed by Edits to Media, T0165.001: Clipped Content).<br><br>Pro-Kremlin channels embraced the false interpretation that President Duda intended to annex Ukraine, even suggesting the new country would be renamed “Ukropol.” On May 5, a video with Russian subtitles appeared on another channel with the ‘Z’ symbol and a user handle similar to the one used by Rokot|Ryk; the video was also posted to the pro-Lukashenka Telegram channel Zheltye slivi (“Желтые сливы,” or “Yellow Leaks”). The Signal Telegram channel picked up the video and claimed that in the future, President Duda “would be able to rely on the potential of its neighbors” in the Baltic states to build a community of nations. The channel concluded by describing this as an “imperialist statement,” and reiterated that Poland intended to expand its territory. Ukrainian Kremlin-tied channel ZeRada also published the video with the comment, “On what grounds [does Poland] propose to live on Ukrainian land?” and asked whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy should reply to these claims. The post also alluded to the forged images of Polish billboards.<br><br>Meanwhile, on May 4, a video displaying the BBC News logo appeared online, repeating the same allegation that Poland was preparing to send troops to Western Ukraine “under the pretext of protection from Russia.” (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) Captions in the video suggested that the Polish Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces had already ordered the army to “prepare for an invasion of Ukraine,” which was “confirmed” by a “published order” signed by General Mika. The video also asserted that Washington had endorsed Poland’s invasion to Ukraine, while NATO would “officially stand aside.” (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)<br><br>As evidence, the video included a forged document previously analyzed by the DFRLab (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), which allegedly ordered Polish armed forces to prepare airborne units to be deployed in Ukraine. It also showed the fake billboards of General Mika, as well as a helicopter and Polish soldiers allegedly filmed in northern Poland preparing to deploy to Ukraine. The video was disseminated on Twitter, Telegram, and Facebook on multiple languages including Russian, French, Italian, Turkish and Czech (T0101: Create Localised Content).<br><br>A comparison of the fake video with authentic BBC News videos shows that placement of captions, font and graphics mimics authentic BBC videos, including a promotion for viewers to download BBC mobile app. However, as the BBC told Reuters and Konkret 24, the video was not published by the outlet; BBC News journalists Alistair Coleman and Shayan Sardarizadeh also noted on Twitter that the video was fake. Thus it appears to be yet another attempt by malicious actors to impersonate a legitimate news source, similar to another fake BBC News video from April 2022 that accused Ukraine of bombing the Kramatorsk railway station.</i> |

The dehumanizing narrative is not new; an analysis by Logically Facts found a surge in such posts aimed at denying and mocking civilian harm on the Palestinian side since the conflict that began on October 7, 2023.<br><br>However, the now-viral clip depicts behind-the-scenes (BTS) footage of a movie that was shot in 2022.

| [I00174 Academic journals, journalists perpetuate misinformation in their handling of research retractions, a new study finds](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00174.md) | <i>Journals can take months to years to retract unreliable research while journalists often fail to inform the public when the scientific discoveries they have reported on are later determined invalid or fraudulent.<br><br>The analysis reveals researchers play a role, too. Some researchers rely on and use discredited research in their work (T0163.003: Narrative Cites Retracted Academic Research) — even years after a journal has withdrawn the research from publication because problems such as scientific misconduct, significant errors, plagiarism or ethics violations have rendered those results untrustworthy.<br><br>Lead author Stylianos “Stelios” Serghiou explained the new study highlights key problems in the pipeline for communicating science to the public. In an email interview, he stressed the need to correct the scientific record as well as the public record following a retraction, “especially in the case of consequential or highly popularized articles.”<br><br>“When highly popularized research is retracted, we need to consider the obligation to inform the public that this research is no longer considered credible by the scientific community,” Serghiou, who has a medical degree and completed a doctoral degree in epidemiology and clinical research at Stanford University last year, wrote to The Journalist’s Resource.<br><br>The best way to do that, though, is unclear, Serghiou and his colleagues explain in their new paper. When they looked at how people discussed a small sample of retractions on social media, they discovered that, in some cases, “retraction was directly or indirectly associated with the promotion of the initial misinformation.”<br><br>Even though thousands of papers have been retracted over time, they remain rare. About 4 in 10,000 papers are retracted, Science magazine reported in 2018. Retraction Watch, a project of the nonprofit Center for Scientific Integrity, tracks retractions and has built a database of more than 26,000 retractions going back to 1756.<br><br>[...]<br><br>- Most papers and their retractions tend to draw similar amounts of attention from news outlets, social media and other sources. But the most popular papers received 2.5 times as much attention before they were retracted than afterward.<br><br>- A median 457 days passed between a paper’s publication and its retraction.<br><br>- Of the retracted papers examined, 31 were cited more than 100 times each in other research.<br><br>- The most common reason for retraction during the study period was duplication, when a researcher or group of researchers publish the same information in two different papers. The second most common was “fake peer review,” meaning the authors cheated — intentionally or unintentionally — the peer-review process through which scholars vet and evaluate one another’s work. Plagiarism was the third most common reason.<br><br>- Tumor Biology had the largest retraction during the study period. In 2017, the journal published a retraction note withdrawing 103 articles due to fake peer review.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Serghiou explained that journalists should report on retractions to correct the public record, but it’s unclear the best way to do that. He told JR there could be unintended consequences when journalists correct the record — potentially spurring social media users to promote the retracted findings as valid.<br><br>One retracted paper they studied, published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2012, claimed that putting an Elmo sticker on an apple encouraged children to choose apples over cookies. Before its retraction, people tweeted about the paper four times. The retraction, Serghiou noted, led to a flurry of tweets promoting the invalid finding. Someone tweeted a sentence suggesting stickers make children choose fruit over cookies and it was retweeted 742 times (T0163.003: Narrative Cites Retracted Academic Research).<br><br>“In our limited study of tweets about recent popular retracted articles, we were very surprised to witness that retraction without appropriate communication may lead to inadvertent promotion of the results being retracted,” Serghiou wrote to JR.</i> |
| [I00175 Many scientists citing two scandalous COVID-19 papers ignore their retractions](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00175.md) | <i>In June 2020, in the biggest research scandal of the pandemic so far, two of the most important medical journals each retracted a high-profile study of COVID-19 patients. Thousands of news articles, tweets, and scholarly commentaries highlighted the scandal, yet many researchers apparently failed to notice. In an examination of the most recent 200 academic articles published in 2020 that cite those papers, Science found that more than half—including many in leading journals—used the disgraced papers to support scientific findings and failed to note the retractions.<br><br>COVID-19 "is such a hot topic that publishers are willing to publish without proper vetting," even in the face of retractions that made global headlines, says Elizabeth Suelzer, a reference librarian at the Medical College of Wisconsin who has written about problematic citations to a retracted 1998 study in The Lancet falsely linking vaccination to autism.<br><br>Both of the retracted COVID-19 papers, one in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the other in The Lancet, were based on what appeared to be a huge database of patient records compiled from hospitals worldwide by Surgisphere, a small company operated by vascular surgeon Sapan Desai, who was a co-author on each article. The 22 May 2020 Lancet paper ostensibly showed that hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug promoted by President Donald Trump and others, could harm rather than help COVID-19 patients. Its publication led to a temporary halt in a major clinical trial and inflamed an already-divisive debate over the drug, which has proved to be no help against COVID-19. The 1 May NEJM article corroborated other evidence that people already taking certain blood pressure medicines did not face a greater risk of death if they developed COVID-19.<br><br>Questions soon arose about the validity, and even existence, of the Surgisphere database, however, and the retractions followed on 4 June. But of the 200 papers examined by Science—all published after the retractions—105 inappropriately cited one of the disgraced studies (T0163.003: Narrative Cites Retracted Academic Research). In several cases it was a primary source for a meta-analysis combining multiple studies to draw overarching conclusions. In most, the studies were cited as scientific support or context.

| [I00176 Japanese study misrepresented in posts claiming “heart failure surges among Covid-vaccinated”](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00176.md) | <i>In February 2025, viral social media posts appeared, claiming that “Japan sounds alarm as heart failure surges among Covid-vaccinated”. These posts shared what appeared to be a screenshot of an article’s headline. One example was posted by the Facebook page KAG Save America 2024, which received more than 17,000 user engagements and more than 10,000 shares. Another example was this TikTok video, viewed more than 209,000 times.<br><br>The link shown in the image takes one to this study, published in the Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy, titled “SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis: An analysis of the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database”.<br><br>We were unable to find an article carrying the same headline shown in these posts, but we did find this article by Slay News, published on 18 January 2025, with a similar headline: “Japan Sounds Alarm as Heart Failure Surges 4900% Among Covid-Vaxxed”. This article also referenced the same study.<br><br>The Slay News article was shared on X by accounts with large followings, such as Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the Los Angeles Times who’s endorsed U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary nominee RFK Jr.; Jim Ferguson, a former candidate for the Brexit Party in the 2019 UK General Elections who’s spread vaccine misinformation; and Mary Talley Bowden, an otolaryngologist who spread COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation.<br><br>But the study doesn’t support the claim (T0163.002: Narrative Misrepresents Findings of Cited Academic Research), and the scientific evidence shows that on balance, COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of complications from the disease, including heart complications. We explain below.<br><br>What did the study do and what did it find?<br><br>The study examined the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database, which is the Japanese equivalent of the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Like VAERS, this database collects information about adverse events occurring after vaccination. And like VAERS, a report alone isn’t sufficient evidence that a vaccine caused an adverse event.<br><br>Examining data from April 2004 to December 2023, the researchers found 880,999 adverse event reports following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, of which 1,846 were myocarditis and 761 were pericarditis. The data showed that most affected individuals were male and aged 30 years or below. The period between vaccination to onset of symptoms was eight days and below. These findings are consistent with that of previous studies that found an association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and myocarditis.<br><br>The researchers concluded that “In the Japanese population, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination was significantly associated with the onset of myocarditis/pericarditis […] although most adverse events occurred early after vaccination, overall outcomes were good”. The study didn’t report any alarming trends, contrary to the implications in the posts.<br><br>Study didn’t look at heart failure; benefits of vaccines outweigh their risks<br><br>Contrary to the claim in the posts, the study was unrelated to heart failure, a condition in which the heart no longer pumps blood as well as it should. Myocarditis, on the other hand, is inflammation of the heart muscle, and it isn’t the same as heart failure. Heart failure can be a complication of myocarditis, but it’s important to note that myocarditis associated with COVID-19 vaccination is typically mild. Most patients go on to make a full recovery after rest and medication.<br><br>Furthermore, the study didn’t account for whether affected individuals had COVID-19 or other viral infections before developing myocarditis. This is important because one of the most common causes of myocarditis is infection by a virus, like those that cause the flu and the common cold. This is one reason the study cannot reliably assess whether myocarditis cases were actually caused by the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.<br><br>Studies have shown that compared to COVID-19 vaccination, COVID-19 is associated with a greater risk of myocarditis, along with other complications like blood clots. The American Heart Association considers the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines to outweigh their risks. An expert consensus by the American College of Cardiology found that “a very favorable benefit-to-risk ratio exists with the COVID-19 vaccine for all age and sex groups evaluated thus far”.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Social media posts misrepresent a Japanese study about adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination (T0163.002: Narrative Misrepresents Findings of Cited Academic Research), falsely claiming it showed heart failure is surging in vaccinated people (T0160.002: Information is False). The study examined myocarditis cases following COVID-19 vaccination, but its findings are consistent with those reported in previous studies, and it didn’t mention heart failure.<br><br>While COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are associated with rare cases of myocarditis, particularly in young males, COVID-19 itself is associated with a greater risk of myocarditis, along with other complications. On balance, the benefits of the vaccines outweigh their risks.</i> |

It encouraged further studies to identify the causes.<br><br>Excess deaths remain high with no cause identified<br><br>The study referenced in the post and article was published June 3 in BMJ Public Health, a publication of the British Medical Journal. In it, researchers from the Netherlands stated that excess mortality in Western nations remained high from 2020 to 2022, even after the adoption of preventative measures and vaccines to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19.<br><br>While noting the correlation, the study was explicit in its conclusion – and the British Medical Journal reiterated in a follow-up statement – that the research did not identify a cause of the excess deaths.<br><br>“Excess mortality has remained high in the Western World for three consecutive years, despite the implementation of containment measures and COVID-19 vaccines,” the study’s conclusion reads. “This raises serious concerns. Government leaders and policymakers need to thoroughly investigate underlying causes of persistent excess mortality.”<br><br>As the misrepresentation of the report spread, the British Medical Journal released a statement further stressing that researchers didn't identify a cause for the excess deaths.<br><br>“The researchers looked only at trends in excess mortality over time, not its causes,” the statement said in part. “While the researchers recognize that side effects are reported after vaccination, the research does not support the claim that vaccines are a major contributory factor to excess deaths since the start of the pandemic. Vaccines have, in fact, been instrumental in reducing the severe illness and death associated with COVID-19 infection.”<br><br>The statement also notes that different methods of data reporting and varying data quality from nation to nation further complicate identifying causal relationships.</i> |

| [I00179 Digging into the math of a study attacking the safety of the abortion pill](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00179.md) | <i>The Ethics and Public Policy Center, a think tank that says it opposes “the extreme progressive agenda while building consensus of conservatives,” recently issued a report on a key abortion medication, mifepristone, that it says raises questions about its safety. After analyzing insurance claims for more than 865,000 prescribed mifepristone abortions, the group said it had determined that almost 11 percent of women experienced a “serious adverse event,” much higher than an overall 0.5 percent rate found in clinical studies.<br><br>That headline number led Republicans like Sen. Josh Hawley (Missouri) to declare that the abortion pill is dangerous. “Those are astounding, jaw-dropping numbers, and they have been largely hidden from the public,” he said in an opinion article in the Federalist. An adverse health event, he noted, is “a major, potentially life-threatening medical disaster. We’re talking about things like sepsis, infection, and hemorrhaging, the kind of things that land you in an ER.”<br><br>Citing the report, Hawley on Thursday secured a commitment from Jim O’Neill, the Trump administration nominee for deputy secretary of Health and Human Services, to review the safety of mifepristone.<br><br>A medication abortion using a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol in 2023 accounted for 63 percent of abortions, double the percentage in 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Since 1988, about 100 countries have approved the use of mifepristone, according to Gynuity Health Projects, which also favors abortion rights.<br><br>We dug into the EPPC report, which calls the use of mifepristone “chemical abortions,” and posed 20 questions to EPPC, which were answered in detail via email by spokesman Hunter Estes after consultation with the researchers. The report lists 94,605 adverse events, for a rate of 10.93 percent, between 2017 and 2023. (Some women had more than one event, so the report says it avoided double-counting when calculating overall rate.) But the headline number seems less solid when the individual data presented in the report is examined.<br><br>We should note that, unlike most credible medical studies, the report did not undergo a formal external peer review before publication (T0163.004: Narrative Cites Academic Research not Peer Reviewed). Estes said “the study was internally reviewed and adjudicated by a panel of physicians, who carefully evaluated the clinical classifications, coding, and outcome assessments to ensure medical accuracy and consistency.”</i> |

The authors believed direct-to-consumer advertising played a part in encouraging more use of psychotropics.<br><br>Another finding in the MAHA report about asthma drug prescriptions said “an estimated 25-40% of mild cases are overprescribed,” citing a nonexistent article. Pediatric pulmonologist Dr. Harold J. Farber, who was listed as the article’s supposed first author, told NOTUS that was an “overgeneralization” of his research.<br><br>The updated report removed those figures.

At least half of these would be expected to be women, so the number of women of child-bearing age (taking the vaccine) is estimated to have increased from 665,424 to 2,146,866 for the same time frame," the MHRA said. <br><br>It is estimated that as many as 26% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, with nearly 80% of early miscarriages occurring in the first 12 weeks, or first trimester, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.<br><br>Given this, the MHRA acknowledged "some miscarriages would be expected to occur following vaccination purely by chance." <br><br>The Daily Expose article also claims two separate incidences of a premature birth and a stillbirth following vaccination. The MHRA explained that in the U.K., around 8 in 100 births are premature, so some would be expected to happen after vaccination also "purely by chance."  <br><br>The MHRA, however, disputed the claim of the stillbirth, telling Reuters some events can be incorrectly reported. It confirmed "no actual stillbirths" were reported to the agency at the time of its statement to Reuters in late March. <br><br>[...]<br><br>We rate this claim MISSING CONTEXT because without additional context it might be misleading (T0162: Reframe Context, T0160.004: Information is Misleading). Claims of miscarriages increasing by 366% over a six-week period originate from a U.K.-based alternative media site, The Daily Expose, citing data from the U.K.'s regulatory body, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. While the total counts of miscarriages are accurate, The Daily Expose article fails to take into account the increased number of women being vaccinated over the six-week time period (from December 2020 to March) alongside the expected frequency of miscarriages in the general population, which is around 26% (T0164.003: Narrative Uses Misinterpreted Statistics to Support Claim). The MHRA has stated there is no cause-and-effect association between COVID-19 vaccinations and the incidence of miscarriage. </i> |

The data source it cites does not list any cause for reported excess deaths in the U.S. Experts say COVID-19 infections make up most of those deaths (T0164.003: Narrative Uses Misinterpreted Statistics to Support Claim).<br><br>The Expose article is based on data collected by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development from publicly available CDC reports that show there were more than 1 million excess deaths during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>The report compares the average number of deaths in a given week from 2015-2019 to the period between December 2020, when vaccines first were authorized in the U.S., and the week of Sept. 25, 2022. It does show 1.1 million more deaths than would be expected historically.<br><br>There is, however, no publicly available evidence from the CDC or elsewhere to suggest those deaths were the result of the COVID-19 vaccines, according to Miguel Gorman, a spokesman for the organization, which compiles and tracks COVID-19 data.<br><br>“We don’t currently have information regarding cause of death to determine what caused the excess deaths,” Gorman said in an email.<br><br>Other experts pointed to COVID-19 itself as the culprit.<br><br>“The bulk of the excess deaths were a direct result of COVID-19 infections, but pandemics have major cascading impacts on all aspects of society,” Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told The Washington Post.<br><br>For example, Adalja suggested the pandemic could have indirectly led to a rise in drug overdoses, as drug users were less likely to seek treatment and more likely to be in isolation.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The post from The Expose also points to data from the United Kingdom it says bolsters its claim that the vaccine is causing deaths instead of saving lives, but that analysis falls apart as well.<br><br>The article cites a July data set from the Office for National Statistics, the U.K.’s national statistical institute. The Expose claims the data show that vaccinated people are more likely to die than the unvaccinated across all age groups, then tries to apply what it says are death rates from the data to the excess deaths in the U.S.<br><br>But that analysis makes several mistakes, according to Sarah Caul, head of mortality analysis at the office.

Jipping similarly presented a series of arguments against Bader Ginsburg’s nomination, among them referencing the same USCCR report co-authored by Bader Ginsburg. He argued that, in this report, Bader Ginsburg’s recommendations included drafting women into the military, legalizing prostitution, constitutionally protecting bigamy, and “lowering the age of consent for sexual acts to 12 years.”<br><br>Sex Bias in the U.S. Code, the USCCR report, is visible online. It was published in 1977, a date also referenced in some of the Facebook claims.<br><br>A section beginning on page 95 described how the law stood at the time (“Under 18 U.S.C. 1153 and 2032, it is a crime for a person to have carnal knowledge of a female not his wife who has not reached 16 years of age”) and noted that the legal definition of rape assumed the offender was a man and the victim was a woman. The report argued: “These provisions clearly fail to comply with the equal rights principle. They fail to recognize that women of all ages are not the only targets of sexual assault; men and boys can also be the victims of rape.”<br><br>On page 102, the report recommended removing the phrase “carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife who has not attained the age of sixteen years” and replacing it with “a Federal, sex-neutral definition of the offense patterned after S. 1400 section 1633”.<br><br>The report goes on to quote directly from S. 1400, which was a proposed Senate bill under which a person would be guilty of an offense if they compelled someone else to take part in sex by force or threats, by drugging or intoxicating them, or if “the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old”.<br><br>Bader Ginsburg was arguing in the report for a broader, gender-neutral definition of rape. The passage that her critics cite as evidence she favored lowering the age of consent is actually a quote from a proposed Senate bill (T0162: Reframe Context), not from Bader Ginsburg (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). The focus of Bader Ginsburg’s argument was not on the age of consent, but on removing an antiquated definition that assumed only women could be targets of sexual assault.<br><br>Bader Ginsburg had put forward the same argument in an earlier report, “The Legal Status of Women under Federal Law”, co-authored with Brenda Feigen Fasteau in 1974 (see Title 18 section, page 78 of PDF).

"Angelina Jolie, $20,000,000. Sean Penn, $5,000,000. Jean-Claude Van Damm (sic), $1,500,000. Orlando Bloom, $8,000,000. Ben Stiller, $4,000,000."<br><br>The video uses the E!

The video was also spread by Donald Trump Jr. on X.<br><br>The video is a fabrication that wasn't reported or published by E! News, a company spokesperson said (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). The video is consistent with material created by a Russia-aligned influence campaign, disinformation experts said.<br><br>President John F. Kennedy created USAID by executive order after signing the Foreign Assistance Act in 1961. The global aid agency has been targeted for apparent dismantling by billionaire Elon Musk (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), the head of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Trump told reporters he loved "the concept" of USAID but claimed the agency "turned out to be radical left lunatics."<br><br>The video in the Facebook post plays into the scrutiny of the agency by linking USAID to Hollywood celebrities and U.S. support for Ukraine. But the video is not a real news report from E! News. It's a fabrication that deceptively uses the branding of the entertainment news outlet to spread a false narrative (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>An E!

Stiller wrote in an X post that his trip to Ukraine was "completely self-funded." Mathew Rosengart, Penn's longtime lawyer, similarly said in an email that Penn's travel to Ukraine was "self-funded" and not sponsored by USAID. A spokesperson for Angelina Jolie, who declined to be identified, also told USA TODAY the payment claim was wrong and Jolie has personally covered the cost for all her humanitarian missions.<br><br>Patrick Warren, co-director of the Media Forensics Hub at Clemson University and researcher of online disinformation, said he's "confident" the video traces back to Russia because it has indicators consistent with the ongoing Russia-aligned Matryoshka influence campaign, including the mimicking of an authentic news outlet, the use of an AI voiceover (T0166: AI-Generated Content) and the targeting of Ukraine.<br><br>This type of Russian malign influence commonly takes advantage of "current news – like U.S. AID – to insert anti-Ukraine messaging into the discourse," Warren said in an email. He added the video in the Facebook post was first shared on X by an account that "regularly initiates" narratives propagated by the Kremlin-aligned Storm-1516 influence network. The narrative in the fabricated video appeared on Russian state media around the same time the X post was shared and appeared on pro-Russian Telegram channels, Warren said.<br><br>Darren Linvill, another co-director of Clemson's Media Forensics Hub, noted in an X thread that Musk and Trump Jr. amplified the video and that it had "every indication of being a Russian-fabricated video" that never appeared on E!

A recent tweet claimed that media outlets were using clips from the movie Deep Impact to report the war. The tweet compared two similar images which show people running on a highway packed with cars. One image had text which said Deep Impact, and the other with the logo of TGcom24, an Italian news channel, with the text "Escape from Kiev."<br><br>After analyzing TGcom24's reports of Ukraine and Russia, it is clear that the news channel did not use footage from the movie. After comparing the image from the tweet with video footage from TGcom24, Logically found that the image is altered (T0165: Edited Content). The logo in the tweet is hazy and pixelated. The logo's format and placement were also different in the tweet.

| [I00215 MATRYOSHKA: A pro-Russian campaign targeting media and the fact-checking community](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00215.md) | <i>Since late 2023, VIGINUM has observed and documented a malicious campaign that could affect French-speaking public debate online. <br><br>[...]<br><br>Active on X since at least September 2023, the Matryoshka campaign is an operation conducted in two stages: <br><br>- A first group of accounts, known as “seeders”, posts fake content on the platform (see section 2.2); <br><br>- A second group of accounts, known as “quoters”, then shares a seeder’s post in response to posts by media outlets, public figures and fact-checkers (T0039.001: Collaborating Assets Seed and Ping). <br><br>The quoters contact targeted individuals or organizations to ask them to check the authenticity or veracity of content posted by the seeders (T0039.002: Solicit Production of Fact Check). Since September 2023, Matryoshka operators have conducted at least 90 successive operations, during which they adapted and tested different methods to disseminate content and bring it to the attention of their targets.<br><br>2.1.1 Content dissemination pattern<br><br>Matryoshka operations generally involve two or three seeders that initially post the content on X within a few minutes of each other. Some 30 to 40 minutes later, two or three quoters start to share the seeders’ posts, commenting on the target’s latest post. Quoters frequently add text, an emoji, or simply mention the target, this addition being unique for each operation and quoter. This second phase usually lasts several hours, with an average of 45 seconds between each quote (T0039.001: Collaborating Assets Seed and Ping).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Furthermore, the X accounts involved in the Matryoshka campaign are used to conduct several successive operations, a quoter’s account almost systematically becoming a seeder’s account and vice versa. For example, @wosuhitsu1972 was involved in at least five Matryoshka operations from 14 to 28 March 2024, in turn as a quoter, a seeder, a seeder, a quoter then a seeder (T0039.001: Collaborating Assets Seed and Ping). The account has since been suspended.<br><br>Moreover, from September 2023 to February 2024, most seeders’ and quoters’ accounts seem to have been bought from a specialized company (T0146: Account Asset, T0150.006: Purchased Asset). Some weeks before they were involved in the Matryoshka campaign, some accounts suggested in their display name that they were part of the WebMasterMarket company, which sells X accounts. They also share common features, including links with people from Asia, past creation dates, and recent posts promoting crypto assets such as Memecoin. <br><br>Created shortly before the operations (T0150.001: Newly Created Asset), all the accounts used have digitally generated profile pictures, do not mention a biography or location, and do not have any subscribers or subscriptions. As it stands, VIGINUM considers that the accounts used by Matryoshka could have been bought in different pools by the campaign, and even possibly compromised.<br><br>[...]<br><br>2.2.1 Misleading and untruthful content aimed at discrediting Ukraine and its allies <br><br>This campaign first seems to have appeared on September 5, 2023,27 with a first post sharing a report impersonating Fox News (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) and asking various media outlets to check the information (T0039.002: Solicit Production of Fact Check). <br><br>The Matryoshka campaign then primarily involved dissemination of false graffiti and posts spoofing the visual identity of Western media outlets, institutions and NGOs using the above procedure (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). To date, this content has been published in French, English, Italian, German, Russian and Ukrainian (T0101: Create Localised Content). <br><br>Matryoshka spreads three types of content impersonating media outlets, institutions and NGOs: <br><br>- Video reports with untruthful content using the visual identity and fonts of the organization (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). These false reports appear to be produced using royalty-free stock images and music;<br><br>- False screenshots presenting an excerpt of an article, an Instagram story or a short YouTube video from a media outlet (T0161.001: Impersonated Content), organization or individual (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution); <br><br>- Fake official documents impersonating a government body (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content). <br><br>Other posts involve disseminating fake images of graffiti in the streets of major Western cities (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage). These graffiti images are produced using a montage of a photograph of a real place and a caricature targeting Ukrainian or European figures. These manipulated images may also spoof the visual identity of street artists, like the French artist Lekto (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.100: Individual Persona). <br><br>The narratives pushed by these publications primarily target Ukraine and aim to discredit its government and President, or else to criticize the arrival of Ukrainian refugees in Western countries. For example, many instances of fake graffiti, often anti-Semitic, depict Volodymyr ZELENSKYY as a beggar or war criminal, and several false reports have presented Ukrainian refugees in Europe in an unfavourable light.<br><br>2.2.2 France, a key target of the Matryoshka campaign<br><br>Other narratives aim to discredit European governments, and particularly their policy supporting Ukraine. As such, France constitutes a key target for the campaign’s operators. <br><br>The media outlets BFMTV, Le Parisien, Libération, Le Monde and La Montagne (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), as well as the Banque de France, the city of Paris and the Directorate-General for Internal Security (DGSI) (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona) have been impersonated by the Matryoshka campaign. Moreover, several cases of fake graffiti (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage) purported to be situated in and around Paris. This false content targeting France spread several narratives aimed notably at sowing distrust of French institutions and government members.</i> |
| [I00216 Rats, bedbugs, tuberculosis, and financial problems. Russian propaganda disinformation about the Paris Olympics](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00216.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] Russian propaganda began actively attacking France and its President Emmanuel Macron in connection with a different news story. On February 27, Macron stated that he wouldn't rule out sending French troops to Ukraine, and subsequently reiterated his stand. Soon after, in Telegram channels that regularly publish disinformation, the French president temporarily eclipsed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy: it was Macron, for example, who was the subject of the majority of fake magazine covers in the first months of 2024 (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>By the end of March, the fakers' attention had shifted to a project of great importance to Macron and his government: the Paris Olympics.<br><br>Bedbugs and rats<br><br>In the second half of 2023, the internet was flooded with reports of bedbugs in France. They were found everywhere: in apartments, hospitals, schools, and public transportation. But only some of the reports were true. The problem does exist: for example, BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield cited experts in one of his reports who said it occurs at the end of every summer. But the reports about the bedbug infestation, which allegedly led to the possible cancellation of the Games and the widespread closure of hospitals, turned out to be false (T0160.002: Information is False). They were created by pro-Kremlin Telegram channels.<br><br>A striking example of this mixture of truth and lies is the news about a bedbug-infested hospital in the northern French city of Arras. On April 9, 2024, the newspaper La Voix du Nord reported that the patient found with bedbugs had been isolated, while the other patients were transferred to nearby healthcare facilities. Major French media outlets, including Le Figaro , later reported on this story . On April 11, the Telegram channel " Shkvarka 2.0 " expanded on this story, claiming that 11 hospitals and 24 emergency rooms had allegedly closed in France in recent weeks for similar reasons. The post was accompanied by a video featuring the Le Figaro logo, emphasizing that this all happened approximately 100 days before the Olympic opening ceremony (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The French outlet did release a video about the events in Arras on April 9, but it made no mention of hospitals being closed nationwide. The fake copy included fragments containing false information, and one frame immediately featured captions in English.<br><br>To illustrate the fake, the creators used a stock photo from the internet. The Alamy photo agency website states that it is of an emergency room in London.<br><br>The day after the video with the fake fragments was published, a report appeared on the PoliTube_news Telegram channel claiming that French intelligence services had allegedly initiated an investigation into the journalists who reported on the closure of the Arras hospital. The post was also accompanied by a video, this time featuring the BFMTV logo.<br><br>The video claimed that the French Ministry of the Interior's General Directorate of Internal Security (DGSI) was investigating reporters from BFMTV, La Voix du Nord, and France 3. Le Point contacted all the journalists mentioned in the article, who said they were hearing about it for the first time and laughed at the news. Editorial management took the fake news more seriously: BFMTV CEO Marc-Olivier Faugiel promised to sue for illegal use of the company's logo and announced that La Voix du Nord would join the lawsuit (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>The video's fake nature is evidenced not only by the journalists' statements but also by technical details. BFMTV's short videos on social media are designed completely differently, from the font to the color of the captions. The creators of the fake video chose a font similar to the one the publication uses in its video previews, but the text in the BFMTV videos themselves is formatted differently.<br><br>The creators of Olympic fakes haven't forgotten another favorite tactic: fake graffiti (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage). Over the past two years, "Verified" has debunked nearly two dozen fake street art posts, all created using the same principle: digitally overlaying a drawing onto a real photo.<br><br>For example, on March 29, the Telegram channel " Shkvarka 2.0 " published a photo of a mural depicting the "symbol of the Paris Olympics"—a bug twirling gymnastics hoops in the colors of the Olympic rings. A week and a half later, on April 9, the channel " V Ruka Kremlya Z " showed a new mural on the wall of another building, a photo allegedly sent by a subscriber. "What are the Paris Olympics based on? Three sewer rats and a giant bug. This is the attitude of the French towards the upcoming Olympics depicted on a huge mural in Paris," the post read.<br><br>Unfortunately, it was impossible to find the exact locations of the murals based on the images (the photographers took pains to avoid including any identifying marks), but there's no doubt that street art like this has never existed on the streets of the French capital (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage). Firstly, the images were posted by channels that have been repeatedly caught spreading fakes. Secondly, there are no photos of these murals from other angles online. And finally, no French media outlets covered them. However, these fakes didn't garner much interest from Russian-speaking Telegram users either: according to "Verified" estimates based on TGStat data, both stories received a combined total of approximately 150,000 views.<br><br>From late March to early April, pro-Kremlin channels generated numerous such stories. For example, a video about elevated levels of a pesticide used to kill rats and bedbugs in Parisian tap water was allegedly released by Le Figaro (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), citing Professor Yves Lévy (the professor is real, but the citation is not available in open sources (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)). Or the story about the bedbug-infested Olympic Village—this time, the post was accompanied by a fragment of an unrelated Euronews broadcast, with a feed from the AFP agency (the agency that allegedly broke the news) shown on the right side of the screen (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content).<br><br>In one of the stories, the authors of the fake attempted to combine several themes: bedbugs, rats, political scandal, and the general negative attitude toward the Olympics. It was first published on April 18 by the Telegram channel " Primorsky zov ." It claimed that former French Economy Minister Jean-Louis Borloo compared the Paris Olympics to "a gypsy camp that comes to the city, provides a momentary joy, and leaves behind financial losses, dirt, disease, and rats." A video featuring the TF1 logo claimed that the former minister's remark sparked a scandal: Norman Rudevich, head of the International Roma Union, allegedly condemned Borloo for discrimination.<br><br>This fake is a mixed bag. Firstly, it's unlikely that a French television channel would have presented Borloo as a former Minister of the Economy – he held that post for exactly a month in 2007, but spent three years as Minister of Ecology, Energy, and Sustainable Development. Secondly, he never uttered such a phrase (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). In February 2023, Senator Hervé Marcel, head of Borloo's Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) party, did indeed refer to a "gypsy camp ," but this inappropriate comparison was made to the left-wing France Insoumise party's behavior in the National Assembly during the debate on pension reform, not to the upcoming Olympics. Marcel later apologized , but Borloo had nothing to do with this story. Finally, the video itself is fake. TF1 has never produced a video like this (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the footage of Borloo is excerpts from his interview with France Inter radio on June 22, 2023 (T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), in which he didn't mention the Olympics, gypsies, rats, or bedbugs.<br><br>Pollution of the Seine<br><br>The Seine plays a key role in the symbolism of the 2024 Olympics. The opening ceremony, scheduled for July 26, will take place on the river. The delegations of the participating teams will be carried on 160 boats past all the main Parisian landmarks: Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower, and the Louvre. However, the Seine has never been known for its cleanliness, and the French authorities are doing everything possible to improve this. Macron has repeatedly promised to swim in the Seine himself before the Olympics to prove the safety of the water in Paris's main river—and he's not alone. Mayor Anne Hidalgo and IOC President Thomas Bach have also made similar statements.<br><br>In March and April, fakers began to exploit the Seine's pollution theme (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). On April 16, the Telegram channel " Z_O_V " reported that ironic graffiti had appeared on the Seine embankment: it depicted the three-eyed fish Blinky (who lives in ponds near the nuclear power plant in The Simpsons) jumping out of the river and claiming the water in the Seine is absolutely clean. This story turned out to be one of the most viral of all Olympic fakes studied by "Verified," garnering over 250,000 views on Telegram (largely due to a post on the major channel " Two Majors "). We determined the exact location from which the photograph that served as the basis for the fake was taken: it is the Left Bank of the Seine, and the embankment where the graffiti is supposedly located is opposite, on the Île de la Cité, not far from Notre-Dame Cathedral. However, it is unlikely that Parisians saw this drawing, since not a single French media outlet reported on it, and local residents and numerous tourists did not post photos on social media (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage).<br><br>Pro-Kremlin Telegram channels also exploited the Seine's polluted water theme using another of their traditional methods : a fake cover (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). The story about Macron's promise to swim in the river was depicted using a fake cover from the German satirical magazine Titanic. "I will prove that the water in the Seine is absolutely safe for the Olympic Games," Macron says in the cartoon, then dives in and emerges a mutant.<br><br>The real April issue of Titanic has a completely different cover (with Hitler smoking marijuana)—the magazine typically covers German news, not events relevant to other countries. Furthermore, the authors never corrected the errors found on other fake covers of the publication: for example, the word "issue" (Ausgabe) is misspelled (Aufgabe).<br><br>Ukrainians and tuberculosis<br><br>Sanitary and epidemiological fakes about the Paris Olympics aren't limited to bedbugs, rats, and dirty water in the Seine. Another popular story concerns tuberculosis, which Ukrainians are bringing to France. One claim claims that 85% of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel who arrived in France for rehabilitation were diagnosed with the disease, and that the doctors treating them also became infected. A post that first appeared on the Shkvarka News channel on March 27 cited screenshots from videos featuring the logos of France 24 and RFI as evidence (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Four days later, the same channel reported that French authorities would introduce mandatory tuberculosis testing for Ukrainian refugees, and on April 18, they updated the story, claiming that $2 billion had been allocated for testing, and that luggage would also be checked for parasites. In all three cases, the primary sources were the Telegram channels "Shkvarka News" and "Shkvarka 2.0," where posts appeared simultaneously. The last two publications about Ukrainian refugees included videos with the RFI logo as evidence (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The latter is the most detailed and deserves a closer look.<br><br>The video cites a document allegedly from the French Ministry of Labor and Health, which outlines stricter controls for Ukrainians arriving in the country. It concludes by stating that those who refuse to undergo testing for tuberculosis, hepatitis A, B, and C, HIV, and other diseases, including COVID-19, will be deported within 48 hours.<br><br>The ministry's website doesn't list such an order in the official documents section , and no documents signed by the minister were issued on April 17 (the date indicated on the document in the video) (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). Searching the website for the words "tuberculosis" and "Ukraine" reveals only a memo drafted in the spring of 2022, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. It states that the fight against tuberculosis in Ukraine is not as intensive as in France, so adults are advised to get tested. Testing is mandatory for children. However, no penalties are stipulated for refusal, and the document has not been updated since the summer of 2022.<br><br>However, as in previous cases, the problem exists: in its March report, the French National Health Agency noted the rise in registered tuberculosis cases in the country and cited statistics showing that the incidence rate among Ukrainian refugees is 197 per 100,000 people (for comparison, in France as a whole, it is no more than 10 per 100,000 people) (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). Nevertheless, vaccination remains voluntary, the report emphasizes.<br><br>Finally, the videos themselves have no connection to RFI or France 24. There are no videos about Ukrainians and tuberculosis on either RFI's website or its YouTube channel. Furthermore, on March 28, the company issued a special statement condemning the use of its logo to create a fake news story about allegedly infected Ukrainian soldiers. And fact-checkers at France 24 mentioned this series of fakes in one of their analyses.<br><br>"The Games Will Be a Disaster": Sponsor Withdrawal and Spectator Problems<br><br>The leitmotif of Olympic fakes is the impending failure of the Games. The stories described above described problems that would allegedly seriously complicate the competition. In the reality created by the fakers, this was confirmed by the decisions made by the competition sponsors and tourists planning to attend.<br><br>On April 8, a post appeared on the Telegram channel "Mariupol Party Girl" claiming that three companies—Spotify, Lego, and Hochland—had disappeared from the sponsors section of the 2024 Olympics website. Attached to the post was a video featuring the TF1 logo , which supported the news with screenshots of the website and a commentary by economist Jacques Attali.<br><br>These companies are indeed not listed in the "Partners" section of the official Olympics website , which is not surprising: none of them have publicly announced any such contracts with the IOC or the Paris Organizing Committee (T0160.002: Information is False). The Ukrainian fact-checking project " Gvara Media " received comments from official representatives of Spotify, Lego, and Hochland, who assured that they have never been partners of the Paris Olympics. Jacques Attali also responded to the inquiry, stating that he neither said nor thought the words attributed to him in the video (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). Finally, the video is also not available on TF1 platforms (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>Pro-Kremlin Telegram channels claim that not only sponsors but also spectators are abandoning the Olympics. On March 27, the aforementioned " Shkvarka 2.0 " channel posted a video featuring the France 24 logo, claiming that Airbnb would automatically make Olympic bookings in France non-refundable due to mass cancellations. In March alone, Airbnb users allegedly canceled over 23,000 bookings, costing the service over €600,000 in losses, the video claimed.<br><br>Fact-checkers from France 24's Les Observateurs project verified that their own channel had not produced such a video (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) and then contacted Airbnb and the expert mentioned in the video for comment. The short-term rental service stated that the cited figures were fictitious and that there were no mass cancellations during the Olympics (T0164.001: Narrative Presents Fabricated Statistics as Genuine Data, T0160.002: Information is False). Meanwhile, the British company Verdant Leisure stated that their tourism expert, Francesca Holdsworth, had not made any such comments to anyone (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>Finally, a logical plotline in this alternative Olympic universe is the persecution of those who "tell the truth." At the very beginning, we reported on the fake investigation that French intelligence services allegedly launched into journalists who wrote about the closure of the Arras hospital. But such a story is not unique.<br><br>On April 2, the same Shkvarka News reported on censorship imposed on French journalists—they were allegedly banned from reporting on issues related to the preparation and hosting of the Olympics. A video confirming this news features the BBC logo, and the investigative project Bellingcat is cited as the source.<br><br>This scheme (a BBC video citing Bellingcat) has become as commonplace as fake magazine covers. At the end of 2023, "Verified" already wrote in detail about the flood of fakes under the British Broadcasting Corporation's brand. This video is no different (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). It consists of stock photos and videos, excerpts from speeches (in this case, TF1 journalist Samira El Ghadir and the channel's executive director, Rodolphe Bellmer) (T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), and screenshots of earlier Olympic fakes are shown as "true reports." Fact-checkers from " Gvara Media " received a comment from Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, who called the video a fake. Bellmer's speech about the alleged censorship introduced in 2024, used in the video, is his speech at the launch of one of TF1's projects in 2023 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current).<br><br>An obvious continuation of the story about the French authorities "concealing the truth" is their crackdown on criticism, including visual criticism. On April 27, the latest fake we've discovered, related to street art and the Olympics, appeared. Simultaneously, the Telegram channels " Shkvarka News " and " Shkvarka 2.0 " reported that an unnamed Parisian municipality had destroyed a supposed €2 million Banksy work. "A drawing of an athlete throwing a rocket appeared in Paris. The word '2024' is written on the athlete's chest. Apparently a reference to the Olympics. But the French are so obsessed with threats surrounding the Olympics that they painted over the graffiti," the posts stated, which garnered only 7,500 views.<br><br>The drawing is based on a real work by Banksy, which he created back in 2012 in the run-up to the London Olympics (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage, T0161.001: Impersonated Content).<br><br>Since the photographs this time showed parts of other buildings, "Verified" was able to pinpoint the exact location . The photo, which was then overlaid with a reworked Banksy mural, was taken in a location already familiar to our regular readers—the commune of Montreuil, east of Paris. Specifically, it was taken on the wall of a building at 31 rue Voltaire. This is the eighth graffiti we've analyzed that was allegedly created in the same area (although it was once claimed to be from Brussels).<br><br>To further enhance the credibility of the story, the fakers also fabricated screenshots of Instagram stories and website pages from the French newspapers Le Parisien and Le Monde, respectively. Neither the former nor the latter published such materials (T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>[...]<br><br>In this article, "Verified" covered only a portion of the fakes about the Paris Olympics created by pro-Kremlin Telegram channels from late March to late April. There are over three dozen of them—and these are just the ones we were able to find. They employed the full arsenal of tools actively used by fakers over the past two years: fake videos from European media outlets, magazine covers, and non-existent graffiti. Some fakes are multi-layered: one media outlet supposedly quotes another, which in turn cites the opinion of a real expert (who, of course, never actually said those words). Clearly, the production line for creating such fakes is well-established.<br><br>However, there's a mystery. None of these fakes went truly viral, with only a few amassing hundreds of thousands of views combined: for example, the post about tuberculosis and Ukrainian refugees only had 130,000. The rest barely circulated online, including in French-language posts on X.<br><br>The goal of these fakes is likely to gain critical mass and create the impression that the Paris Olympics are a surefire failure. Real problems (bedbugs and rats, pollution in the Seine, the cost of the Olympics) are greatly exaggerated in these publications and supplemented with false details.</i> |
| [I00217 False Authority: How the BBC Became a Favorite Brand for Fake Video Creators](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00217.md) | <i>[Translated from original in Russian] The mass production of fake videos featuring the logos of prominent international media outlets is one of the hallmarks of Russia's information war against Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, creators of such fakes have released dozens of videos imitating the designs of Al Jazeera , Euronews , Deutsche Welle , Reuters , Fox News , and other major foreign media outlets  (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). But the British Broadcasting Corporation is a particular favorite among disinformationists. "Verified" explains how the BBC's disinformation videos are made, what they cover, and how to distinguish genuine content from fake.<br><br>What the fake videos say<br><br>At first glance, the videos purporting to be BBC reports focus on events unfolding in various countries around the world (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), but all of them portray Ukraine and Western countries in a negative light. "Verified" is aware of nine such recordings, but there could have been more: some may have failed to resonate and escaped the attention of fact-checkers. <br><br>The most recent of these videos appeared in mid-December 2023. It reported that over 10,000 cameras had been discovered in Ukraine, the data from which had been transmitted to Russia and stored on Russian servers since 2004. Although this video is not available on the BBC's website or official social media accounts, it is based on a genuine journalistic investigation published several days earlier by the " Schemes " project. Its authors discovered that TRASSIR cameras were supplied to Ukraine, the data from which was transmitted through Russian servers and could potentially be accessed by the FSB.<br><br>This is the only case known to "Verified" where a fake BBC video was based on credible information (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0160.001: Information is Verified). The video likely served only a supporting role—it was distributed alongside a fake screenshot of a news story from the British Broadcasting Corporation (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), which quoted US Congressman Matt Gaetz as saying, "For two years, we supported a country that didn't even bother to get rid of Russian cameras in its capital. The question remains, who is dumber: us or the Ukrainians?" Gaetz has consistently opposed further American aid to Kyiv, and his statements on this topic are regularly quoted by Russian state media.<br><br>Another video released in December claimed that Bellingcat investigators had information about Ukraine selling weapons to the terrorist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7. David Arakhamia, chairman of the Servant of the People faction in the Verkhovna Rada, was accused of organizing the deal, and the information was allegedly confirmed by BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizade and Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins. According to TGStat data, this video (which Reuters fact-checkers found to be fabricated (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)) has been viewed over 1 million times in the Russian-language segment of Telegram alone. <br><br>Similar claims (also citing Bellingcat) were present in a video analyzed by "Verified" in October 2023. At the time, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was accused of selling weapons to militants. The video, which garnered roughly the same number of views as the later one, featured the BBC logo and intro, as well as other distinctive design elements, but this video also turned out to be fake (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>A third report based on Bellingcat's "findings," allegedly produced by the BBC, circulated in late November. The video, citing the investigative group, claimed that former adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office Oleksiy Arestovych spent $500,000 on private jets over six months. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied conducting such an investigation. The video also appears to be missing from the BBC's website (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>In early October 2023, a video disguised as a BBC story featuring a prediction by essayist Nassim Taleb circulated. Taleb allegedly claimed that the United States was planning to leave NATO and stop aiding Ukraine. The video, which had garnered several hundred thousand views on Telegram, was nowhere to be found on the British media corporation's website or social media accounts (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), and the writer himself denied ever making such a statement (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>On August 30, fact-checkers at Logically Facts published an analysis of yet another video released on behalf of the BBC, which claimed that Yevgeny Prigozhin did not die in the plane crash in the Tver region, but that his death was allegedly staged by the Kremlin with the consent of the head of the Wagner PMC. The video became popular not only among Russian-speaking internet users (over 3 million views on Telegram) but also in the English-speaking segment (for example, one of the posts on X was viewed over 380,000 times). As in other cases, the video turned out to be a fake, and the BBC had no connection with it (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>The videos described above were edited vertically, but some fake videos were also disguised as more familiar horizontal footage. For example, in early August 2023, a video circulated claiming that "Britain is suffering from sanctions" imposed by London on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine. However, by changing the video's format, its creators stumbled—the BBC does not use such a format for such videos (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The viral video, which consists of a montage of photos and reports unrelated to the topic of sanctions, is not available on the broadcaster's website or social media. The experiment was relatively unsuccessful—the fake story failed to generate much interest in either English or Russian. <br><br>In May 2022, a video widely circulated on social media X , purporting to show BBC journalists showing an order to send Polish troops to Ukraine (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Fact-checkers from the Polish project Demagog discovered that the document was falsified (T0085.004: Develop Document, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona), while their colleagues at Reuters analyzed the video, which mimicked the BBC design, and came to a similar conclusion. In Russian, the image of the order gained more popularity , while in English, the fake footage gained more popularity. <br><br>In April 2022, a video of a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk , killing 61 civilians , went viral . The video, purportedly released by the BBC, blamed Ukraine for the attack (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The subtitles stated that Russia does not use Tochka-U missiles, and the serial number on a shell fragment found at the site of the tragedy indicated that the missile belonged to Ukraine. <br><br>This “BBC story” was broadcast on Russian state television channels (in particular, on “Russia 24”), and also formed the basis for numerous publications in the Russian media .<br><br>Last spring, journalists, fact-checkers, and media researchers first noticed the emergence of several fabricated stories about the war in Ukraine, disseminated under the branding of the BBC and other well-known media outlets. BBC correspondent Joe Inwood wrote on his X account (then Twitter): "...Someone appears to have obtained BBC video tools and created a convincing, but fake, video." <br><br>The fake videos described above were designed identically, using the BBC News banner, the British television channel's logo, and a consistent design code. The vast majority of these videos are vertical and mimic the style of BBC social media posts. The fake videos are primarily edited together from video fragments available in the public domain or produced by other media outlets (T0165: Edited Content, T0084.002: Plagiarise Content), accompanied by subtitles and background music. Similarly, as noted above, over the past year and a half, videos have been faked and attributed to media outlets around the world.<br><br>Along with the fake videos, equally fake screenshots of publications on the websites of various foreign media outlets, including the BBC , were also distributed (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). Sometimes, they even became elements of disinformation videos. For example, a screenshot of a non-existent BBC news story was featured in a video purportedly from Reuters, which reported on appeals from boxer Mike Tyson and actor Elijah Wood to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the Western stars allegedly asked the politician to begin drug addiction treatment (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)).<br><br>Fake reports attributed to the BBC have appeared before, but they were far fewer in number, presented differently, and, in most cases, apparently were not created with the intention of disinformation. For example , in 2018, a video about an imminent nuclear war between NATO and Russia went viral (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona) ( a second wave of distribution occurred in January 2022 (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked)). The video purported to be a clip from a BBC television broadcast, but it turned out that the recording was created independently of the British broadcaster and "purely for entertainment purposes." Neither "Verified" nor other fact-checking projects were able to find any similar disclaimers for more recent videos.<br><br>There's no trace of any of the videos described above, which appeared in 2022–2023, on the BBC website or on the corporation's social media accounts, and the media group's official representatives have repeatedly been forced to claim that the stories are fabricated. These claims are independently confirmed by fact-checking projects operating in various countries. However, by this point, the fake publications have accumulated millions of views and influenced the opinions of many people about the global situation. <br><br>Who is behind the falsifications?<br><br>Many of the videos described above began spreading on social media shortly after the publication of statements by Russian officials and speakers collaborating with state media containing the same points (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). For example, the narrative about Ukrainian weapons in the hands of Hamas militants emerged on October 7, the day of the group's attack on Israel. This was reported in a commentary to Argumenty i Fakty , without citing a source, by orientalist Yevgeny Satanovsky, until recently a regular guest on TV host Vladimir Solovyov's broadcasts. On October 9, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made the same statement on his Telegram channel , and the very next day, a fake video about a non-existent Bellingcat investigation began circulating in the Russian-language segment of Telegram (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). The report that the attack on the Kramatorsk train station was carried out by Ukrainian troops, not Russian ones, was widely disseminated in Russia by federal media on the day of the attack, April 8, 2022. Soon, a video with the BBC logo, repeating the official Russian narrative, appeared on social media (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). <br><br>[...]<br><br>Almost all the videos examined by "Verified" and other fact-checkers mimic the design of the videos the BBC uses on its X social media account and sometimes on Instagram , making them difficult to immediately distinguish from the real thing. However, sometimes it's enough to simply visit the website or the official BBC News accounts on X , Instagram , YouTube , or TikTok to confirm that such information has not been published there.<br><br>There are also a number of significant differences in the design of fake and real videos, which make it possible to determine whether a video is fabricated or not, even without specialized tools or video content verification skills. <br><br>Firstly, the fake videos feature background music, while the originals rarely use it (if music is present, it's overlaid on the main audio track). The so-called caption videos (videos with embedded subtitles) published by the BBC use the original audio from the footage used in the videos , while the fake videos, on the contrary, lack it.<br><br>Secondly, when a genuine BBC report shows a clip of someone speaking, their voice is not muted. For example, in the fabricated December video about Ukraine selling arms to Hamas, the footage of Eliot Higgins and Shayan Sardarizadeh allegedly making this statement is accompanied only by background music, and the British journalist's lip movements make it clear that he is speaking a completely different phrase than the one in the caption. Footage of Nassim Taleb was used in exactly the same way in a report about the impending US withdrawal from NATO. <br><br>Thirdly, although the disinformation campaigners use elements of the BBC video design (the opening title, the logo, the characteristic vertical red stripe near the title), the font in the fake videos does not match the company's.<br><br>Fourth, native speakers may note that the captions of such fake videos regularly contain spelling, grammar, and stylistic errors that are virtually impossible to find in a reputable media corporation. For example, an October video about a Bellingcat investigation includes the phrase "Ukrainian Defense Prime Minister," while the captions of a video about Nassim Taleb's forecast sometimes lack the necessary articles.<br><br>These recommendations apply to any videos of this kind, regardless of whose logo you see in the frame. And they're worth taking on board, as there's no reason to believe that the current method of fake news stories, which generates millions of views, will become tiresome for disinformation makers anytime soon.</i> |

| [I00222 How Russia is trying to disrupt the 2024 Paris Olympic Games](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00222.md) | <i>In the summer of 2023, a curious set of videos crept into social media platforms. Telegram feeds that normally promoted pro-Kremlin narratives suddenly began promoting a film called “Olympics Has Fallen.” Users were encouraged to scan a QR code that directed them to a Telegram channel of the same name (T0153.004: QR Code Asset, T0122: Direct Users to Alternative Platforms, T0151.007: Chat Broadcast Group). Upon arriving at this channel, viewers encountered a feature-length film (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content) with a similar aesthetic and a play on the title of the American political action movie “Olympus Has Fallen,” released more than a decade earlier. AI-generated audio impersonating the voice of film actor Tom Cruise (T0166.001: Deepfake Impersonation, T0088: Develop Audio-Based Content, T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution) narrated a strange, meandering script disparaging the International Olympic Committee’s leadership.<br><br>Nearly a year later and with less than 80 days until the opening of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) has observed a network of Russia-affiliated actors pursuing a range of malign influence campaigns against France, French President Emmanuel Marcon, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the Paris Games. These campaigns may forewarn coming online threats to this summer’s international competition.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Old world tactics meet the age of AI<br><br>Starting in June 2023, prolific Russian influence actors—which Microsoft tracks as Storm-1679 and Storm-1099—pivoted their operations to take aim at the 2024 Olympic Games and French President Emmanuel Macron. These ongoing Russian influence operations have two central objectives: to denigrate the reputation of the IOC on the world stage; and to create the expectation of violence breaking out in Paris during the 2024 Summer Olympic Games.<br><br>The “Olympics Has Fallen” website (T0152.004: Website Asset) and video became the first in many videos MTAC encountered from Storm-1679. The video, which falsely purported to be a Netflix documentary (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content) narrated by the familiar voice of American actor Tom Cruise, clearly signalled the content’s creators committed considerable time to the project and demonstrated more skill than most influence campaigns we observe. Further analysis confirmed the fake documentary used AI-generated audio resembling Cruise’s voice to imply his participation, spoofed Netflix’s iconic intro scene and corporate branding, and promoted bogus five-star reviews from reputable media outlets like the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the BBC, all amid slick computer-generated special effects. Social media accounts associated with Storm-1679 promoted the documentary across several platforms, attempting to reach US and European social media users. As previously reported in MTAC’s December 2023 report, Storm-1679 deceived US celebrities into recording short videos on Cameo (T0010: Cultivate Ignorant Agents), a popular website where users can pay for personalized video messages from celebrities, and deceptively edited the videos into anti-Ukrainian propaganda (T0165: Edited Content). Among the edits to those Cameo videos included advertisements for Olympics Has Fallen and QR-code links to the Telegram channel where it was hosted, giving the false impression that American celebrities were endorsing and promoting the film (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>Videos, fakes, and false flags sow anticipation of violence in Paris<br><br>The “Olympics Has Fallen” video signalled the first glimpse of what would prove to be an extensive campaign by Storm-1679. The Paris 2024 Summer Olympic Games has been one of Storm-1679’s primary objectives since at least the summer of 2023, but MTAC has previously observed this actor heavily targeting the Ukrainian refugee community living in the US and Europe. Their principal tactic involves creation of spoofed content that mimics reputable media outlets (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), particularly in short-form video clips posted on social media.<br><br>Storm-1679’s Olympics-focused disinformation goes beyond defaming the IOC and seeks to foment public fear to deter spectators from attending the Games. Over the past year, Storm-1679 has consistently produced a collection of deceptive videos, suggesting that legitimate and trusted sources are conveying accurate information regarding expected violence during the Paris Games. In a short video, masquerading as a clip from Brussels-based media outlet Euro News (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), Storm-1679 falsely claimed that Parisians were buying property insurance in anticipation of terrorism surrounding the Games (T0160.002: Information is False). In another spoofed news clip, this time impersonating French broadcaster France24 (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), Storm-1679 falsely claimed that 24% of purchased tickets for Olympic events had been returned due to similar fears of terrorism (T0164.001: Narrative Presents Fabricated Statistics as Genuine Data). In a more explicit attempt to dissuade citizens from attending the Games, Storm-1679 produced fake video press releases posing as the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the French General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.206: Government Institution Persona) warning potential attendees to stay away from the Paris 2024 Olympics due to the alleged risk of a terror attack.<br><br>Prior to spring 2024, Storm-1679 primarily launched disinformation operations in English, only occasionally producing content in French and German, among other European languages (T0101: Create Localised Content). MTAC tracked a notable increase in Storm-1679’s French-language content as the Olympics campaign gained steam, possibly signaling an effort to target the French public more directly or set the scene for alleged unrest in the lead-up to the Games.<br><br>The most worrisome disinformation advanced by pro-Russian actors has sought to impersonate militant organizations and fabricate threats to the Games amidst the Israel-Hamas conflict (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). During fall 2023, Storm-1679-linked social media accounts posted images claiming to show graffiti painted in Paris that threatened violence against Israelis attending the 2024 Games (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage). In several of the images, Storm-1679 referenced the attacks at the 1972 Munich Olympics, where members of Black September—an affiliate of the Palestine Liberation Organization—killed 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team and a West German police officer. Microsoft did not observe any independent confirmation that the graffiti physically exists, suggesting the images were likely digitally generated. Separately, in November 2023, a Russian-language X (formerly Twitter) account posted a video purportedly produced by the Turkish ultranationalist organization the Grey Wolves, which included imagery from the 1972 Munich Games attacks, hinting at similar attacks at Paris 2024. The video caused significant confusion online in the hours after it was posted, many assuming it to be authentic, and even prompted a response from the Israeli Olympic Committee. Microsoft does not presently have enough information to attribute the video to a specific actor, but its heavy amplification by pro-Russian bot accounts suggests the video may be another operation in the broader Olympics campaign.<br><br>Storm-1679 is not the only Russia-aligned actor with a particular—and growing—interest in undermining the 2024 Paris Games. The Russia-affiliated influence actor Microsoft tracks as Storm-1099—better known as “Doppelganger”—has also increased its anti-Olympics messaging in the past two months. Articles published by the actor’s core disinformation outlet Reliable Recent News (RRN), as well as any of its 15 unique French-language “news” sites, echo claims of rampant corruption within the IOC and warn of potential violence at the Games. Similarly, in Storm-1099’s spoofs of reputable media outlets—pro-Russian clones of legitimate media websites peddling propaganda (T0152.004: Website Asset, T0143.003: Impersonated Persona, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona)—forgeries of French outlets Le Parisien and Le Point also raise the specter of violence and castigate Macron’s government.

| [I00225 Operation Overload Impersonates Media to Influence 2024 US Election](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00225.md) | <i>Target Audience 1: Media Organizations, Fact-Checkers, and Researchers <br><br>US and international media organizations, fact-checkers, and researchers are almost certainly the primary target audience of Operation Overload, based on industry research, recent credible testimonials from various media organizations, and Operation Overload automated social media accounts (T0146.007: Automated Account Asset) that tag media organizations, request fact-checking verification (T0039.002: Solicit Production of Fact Check), and reply to social media posts from these organizations with spam (T0049.008: Generate Information Pollution). These individuals and organizations themselves are at risk of brand abuse and potential impersonation. Similarly to the Russia-linked influence operation Doppelgänger, Operation Overload frequently abuses logos and stylized wordmarks of US and international media organisations (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). Known tracked organizations impersonated in Operation Overload per Insikt Group’s investigation are available in Appendix A. <br><br>According to CheckFirst, between August 2023 and May 2024, Eastern European fact-checking and counter-propaganda outlets, particularly in Ukraine, were among those “most actively engaged” in publishing debunks of Operation Overload content. Though the reported trend demonstrated Eastern European-based researchers as at the forefront of combatting Russian propaganda, there were concerns about whether these organizations were effectively collaborating on incoming leads. <br><br>Objective 1: Overwhelm Target’s Research Resources <br><br>CheckFirst research indicated that Operation Overload aims to overwhelm journalists and fact-checkers with persistent, spam-like requests to verify the operation’s inauthentic content (T0039.002: Solicit Production of Fact Check), diverting resources from pursuing legitimate investigations and debunking Russian disinformation. The operation almost certainly seeks to inundate media, fact-checkers, and researchers’ resources — both time and personnel — causing time-sensitive, critical, legitimate investigations to be overlooked or delayed (T0049.008: Generate Information Pollution). This tactic creates confusion and distraction, ensuring that key narratives or investigative avenues slip through unnoticed, enabling mis- and disinformation to spread unchallenged. By leading journalists and fact-checkers into pursuing fake fact-checking leads or failing to verify legitimate information, the operation exhausts the capacity of the aforementioned organizations, diminishing their ability to verify accurate information. <br><br>Objective 2: Use Target to Launder Disinformation into Mainstream Discourse <br><br>In pursuing Objective 1, Operation Overload very likely also hopes to use media organizations as a means of information laundering; more specifically, to inject malign content and pro-Kremlin narratives into mainstream political discourse via trusted parties. Should a member of Target Audience 1 3 unintentionally fact-check and publish a report using Operation Overload's fake leads, there is an added risk of giving additional legitimacy to the false story and lending credibility to the operation’s broader themes, increasing the likelihood that audiences will believe it, and pushing malign influence deeper into mainstream discourse (T0039: Bait Influencer).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Insikt Group has observed several instances of Operation Overload content negatively depicting Vice President Harris, the Harris campaign, and members of Vice President Harris’s immediate family in a manner we assess is very likely aimed at undermining her candidacy for president (T0135: Undermine). We have also observed Operation Overload negatively depicting the candidacy of former President Trump, though based on our ongoing collection of Operation Overload content, content negative of Vice President Harris is at least four times more frequent than negative portrayals of former President Trump. Targeting each candidate with content intended to damage their reputation is consistent with historic Russia-linked influence operations against major US elections. We assess that the significant disparity between the level of targeting of each candidate likely indicates whose policies the Kremlin perceives to be better aligned with its strategic objectives. <br><br>To illustrate how Operation Overload targets Vice President Harris’s campaign, one video, impersonating the BBC on Telegram, falsely claimed her campaign lost over $1.2 million on “non-existent advertising services” (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Operation Overload has also produced limited content that discredits the Trump campaign with false claims. For instance, one video impersonating the BBC falsely claimed that former President Trump had received an endorsement from Norwegian neo-Nazi Anders Behring Breivik (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>In another instance, a video impersonating a Fox News brief published on the “Gagauz Republic” Telegram account falsely claimed that Yum! Brands filed a lawsuit against the Harris campaign to prevent it from using Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) in its advertisements (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). The video cited an inauthentic quote attributed to Lexington, Kentucky attorney, J. Dale Golden, who suggested the Trump campaign pressured Yum! Brands to file the fictitious lawsuit, alleging Trump was concerned Harris would attract African-American voters with the KFC brand. The video, using Golden’s likeness, further attempted to reinforce racial stereotypes by stating, “and we all know who enjoys KFC more than anyone else” (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Operation Overload-affiliated social media accounts, as well as Russian-language Telegram accounts posting inauthentic videos deceptively attributed to reliable “sources”, have published clips that vilify Ukrainian refugees in the US as purveyors of crime, drugs, and disease (T0135.001: Smear). For example, video segments impersonating US-based CNN recently suggested that a “Ukrainian woman with HIV infected more than 200 American men” and that “an influx of Ukrainian refugees” resulted in an increase in violence in Los Angeles’s Skid Row neighborhood (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona). In a video impersonating USA Today, Operation Overload assets claimed that Ukrainian refugees “are being used to transport fentanyl” into the US (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Operation Overload very likely attempts to provoke negative sentiment in the US toward the LGBTQIA+ community (T0135.004: Polarise), using disinformation to perpetuate discriminatory beliefs around transgender individuals, perceived behavioral issues, gender transition and reassignment surgeries, and pharmaceutical treatments. One video published in September 2024, impersonating The Washington Post, claimed that LGBTQIA+ families are more likely to be approved for adoption than traditional families, citing fabricated data from the National Children's Bureau (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona, T0164.001: Narrative Presents Fabricated Statistics as Genuine Data).<br><br>[...]<br><br>Professional Imposter <br><br>Operation Overload deploys a range of professional and multi-layered techniques to build credibility and disseminate influence content. The operation’s initial layer to build credibility stems from its repeated misuse of a media organization's brand, including abuse of an organization’s logo, emulation of the brand’s graphics packages for visual media, and attempts to attribute its videos to journalists employed by the impersonated media organization (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). <br><br>The video content from Operation Overload is crafted as if it was found on a legitimate organization’s social media account. The videos are short (one to two minutes in length), incorporate background news audio (sometimes referred to as a “news bed”), and incorporate real footage and static images pulled from publicly available sources. For example, an impersonation of the BBC published on September 20, 2024 (Figure 3), recycled a photograph Vice President Harris posted to her social media account on September 8, 2024, to commemorate National Grandparents Day in the US (T0084.002: Plagiarise Content). <br><br>Further, the videos often cite inauthentic research or investigation findings from reputable organizations and fabricated testimonials attributed to professionals in the corresponding field to falsely appeal to authority and add a layer of legitimacy to the video content (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). For example, many documented videos we attribute to Operation Overload have cited fake research from Bellingcat, almost certainly attempting to exploit the organization’s established credibility as a reputable investigative outlet. <br><br>Insta-imposed <br><br>As demonstrated in Figures 18–23, Operation Overload creates static media that appears to be screenshots taken of Instagram Stories from real media organizations. These fabricated screenshots often include a tagged article link edited onto the image to provide an additional layer of legitimacy (T0122: Direct Users to Alternative Platforms). <br><br>Instagram overlays were mostly used to produce content covering fake graffiti (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage) from multiple angles; these images are similar to other fake graffiti campaigns purportedly across Europe, documented in AFP’s initial analysis as well as in CheckFirst research, which found the “graffiti paintings are deceptively superimposed onto authentic photos of urban landscapes … from places in Germany and France”. Recent examples targeting US audiences, as shown in the following figures, indicate Operation Overload's attempts to attribute the graffiti to legitimate artists, likely to bolster the images’ credibility (T0161.001: Impersonated Content). <br><br>There is a persistent risk that Operation Overload may expand to impersonating additional online video-centric platforms. In early October 2024, Insikt Group located an Operation Overload video on a mainstream social media platform impersonating a YouTube Short posted by US telecommunications company AT&T (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0161.001: Impersonated Content, T0097.205: Business Persona). The AT&T impersonation video urged “viewers” of the YouTube Short to “vote for Harris if you want kids’ [expletive] to be cut” and “vote for Trump if you want prices to be cut”.<br><br>Amplification and Automation Operation <br><br>Overload very likely seeks to amplify its content through CIB, documented email campaigns, and promotion through pro-Kremlin social media personalities. Operation Overload also uses hashtags, such as #BBC, #FoxNews, or #USATODAY, in its posts to increase content views (T0015.001: Use Existing Hashtag). Likewise, we located accounts that directly tag media or other related media organizations and political figures (T0039: Bait Influencer), including persistent requests to verify the videos (T0039.002: Solicit Production of Fact Check), with the likely goal of supplementing the operation’s email campaigns. Notably, the method of reply spam activity is strongly similar to Insikt Group’s observations of the Doppelgänger network in the fall of 2023 and into 2024. <br><br>Insikt Group assesses that many individual social media accounts engaged in persistent social media amplification and CIB to promote Operation Overload content were likely compromised and repurposed for automated engagement boosting (T0146.007: Automated Account Asset, T0150.005: Compromised Asset). This analysis is based on Operation Overload using “aged” accounts, including some that had their original posts from several years ago, often in local languages. The accounts would go dormant for several years and then are suddenly reactivated (T0150.002: Dormant Asset). The social media accounts frequently boost content unrelated to Operation Overload, including likely engagement farming related to cryptocurrency and NFTs. Currently, Insikt Group assesses that the automated accounts are likely services provided by outsourced entities commissioned by the administrators of Operation Overload that advertise social media promotion and engagement boosting. However, additional research on these networks engaged in CIB will be required for further confirmation.<br><br>AI Voiceover Usage <br><br>Insikt Group has observed some videos we attribute to Operation Overload employing the use of AI-generated voiceovers to narrate its content, stylistically similar to a news broadcast or reporting from a legitimate journalist (T0166: AI-Generated Content, T0088: Develop Audio-Based Content). More specifically, the administrators of Operation Overload appear to prefer combining AI-generated voiceovers with content impersonating USA Today, as well as content in Ukrainian. Operation Overload may attempt to integrate AI-generated voiceovers into other content impersonating other media entities.<br><br>QR-edibility <br><br>Social media “seed” accounts that initially post Operation Overload content regularly incorporate the use of QR codes in their posts, almost certainly to aid in establishing credibility for the inauthentic video. The QR codes (T0153.004: QR Code Asset), often marked as “verified”, redirect to the homepage of a trusted organization (such as the BBC, VIGINUM, and so on). Some of these QR codes have previously redirected to a seemingly benign payload hosted on the IP address 127.255.255[.]254. Although benign at the time of writing, we recommend avoiding scanning instances of such QR codes identified in the wild, as they can be leveraged in the future for delivering malware or other malicious activities.<br><br>Insikt Group can further confirm CheckFirst’s own analysis of the QR codes, including Operation Overload’s use of the QR code management tool, me-qr[.]com. Further analysis from CheckFirst indicated that the QR codes were possibly managed by an individual connected to Otri, a Russian marketing agency.</i> |
| [I00226 Headline misrepresents a California reproductive health bill](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00226.md) | <i>CLAIM: A California bill would allow mothers to kill their babies up to seven days after birth.<br><br>AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. A bill in the California legislature, AB 2223, is being falsely represented. It was introduced to provide legal protection to women who lose their child due to pregnancy complications, and those who have abortions. It does not legalize the killing of infants (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>THE FACTS: Social media users are sharing a headline that falsely suggests a proposed California bill will legalize “infanticide,” the killing of an infant (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>“California introduces new bill that would allow mothers to kill their babies up to 7 days after birth,” reads the erroneous headline on a story published on the Miami Standard, a conservative website.<br><br>“To everyone saying it’s fake because it was posted on 4/1 just do some research. 99% of y’all don’t stay in Cali. It’s called The infanticide bill,” claimed a Facebook post sharing a screenshot of the headline on April 1 with over 11,000 reshares.<br><br>But the posts misrepresent the purpose of the bill and its potential impact. The bill eliminates a requirement that a coroner must investigate deaths related to suspected self-induced or criminal abortion. Coroner statements on certificates for a fetal death could not be used to pursue a criminal case against the mother.<br><br>The aim of the bill, introduced Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, a Democrat representing the East Bay, is to protect women who end a pregnancy or have a miscarriage from being investigated, persecuted or incarcerated. Erin Ivie, a spokesperson for Wicks told The Associated Press in an email. “The bill is specific to pregnancy and pregnancy-related outcomes, and does not decriminalize the ‘murder of babies’ in the weeks after birth,” Ivie said.<br><br>Social media users making the false claim cite a line in the bill stating that a person would not have criminal liability in the event of “perinatal death,” a period of time following a birth.<br><br>The section of the bill states: “Notwithstanding any other law, a person shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability or penalty, or otherwise deprived of their rights, based on their actions or omissions with respect to their pregnancy or actual, potential, or alleged pregnancy outcome, including miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion, or perinatal death.”<br><br>The bill does not establish a time frame around “perinatal.” The Miami Standard article defines the period as “up to seven days or more.” The outlet wrote in a response to the AP that, “Perinatal is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as at or around the time of birth. This could extend up to 28 days after the infant has been born.” The outlet included statements by several attorneys from pro-life organizations and firms arguing that the wording could decriminalize killing infants.<br><br>But the term “perinatal death” in the bill is intended to mean the death of an infant caused by complications in pregnancy, according to Ivie. To clarify the term, Wicks added a new amendment to the bill on Monday to change the wording to, “perinatal death due to a pregnancy-related cause.”<br><br>Even without the new amendment, the bill wouldn’t have allowed for “infanticide” or a murder of an infant days after it’s born, since homicide is illegal, according to Farah Diaz-Tello, senior counsel and legal director at If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice.<br><br>Before the bill was introduced, a “legal alert” was issued earlier this year by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, which clarified criminal liability around the death of a fetus, saying prosecutors should not charge women with murder when a fetus dies, even if their behavior may have contributed to the death. He issued the advisory after San Joaquin Valley’s Kings County charged two women, Chelsea Becker and Adora Perez, with “fetal murder,” alleging their drug use led to stillbirths. Becker’s case has been dismissed, and Perez’s conviction was cleared, although her case is ongoing.<br><br>Diaz-Tello says Wicks’ bill could have ensured legal protections for these women from the outset.<br><br>Outside of the two cases, another example where the bill might apply would be a pregnant woman who exhibited signs of preterm labor, but could not afford to be on bed rest, Ivie said. While there could be a chance that the delivery results in a stillborn, the bill would ensure the woman couldn’t be prosecuted if that did occur, Ivie explained.<br><br>“Anti-abortion activists are peddling an absurd and disingenuous argument that this bill is about killing newborns when ironically, the part of the bill they’re pointing to is about protecting and supporting parents experiencing the grief of pregnancy loss,” Wicks said in an email to the AP.<br><br>On Tuesday, the bill passed through the Assembly Judiciary committee with the new amendment and is moving to the health committee hearings.</i> |

Anthony Grayling, the philosopher, described her as a “bald-faced emetic” and Philip Pullman, the author, said he was “aghast”.<br><br>Their collective outrage was directed at the words of Rosie Holt who, asked by an interviewer whether she attended any of the Downing Street parties, said that until Sue Gray completes her report “your guess is as good as mine: I don’t know whether I attended the party” (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>Holt added: “If there was a party in lockdown when we told everyone they couldn’t even attend funerals, but no one knew about it, was there a party?”<br><br>At a glance, Holt may be hard to distinguish from the declining number of Tory MPs prepared to stand up for the prime minister, but she is in fact a satirist (T0097.110: Party Official Persona, T0143.004: Parody Persona) – an actor and comedian with a strong line in parodies of the political speech that veers into drivel. This video sketch (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0160.005: Content Produced as Satire) has taken off – 6 million views on Twitter so far – partly because “an awful lot of people” think it’s real, she said.<br><br>“I don’t go in there to hoodwink people,” she told the Observer. “I get a bit unnerved when lots of people think it’s real because that’s not what I’m trying to do.<br><br>“But there’s also an awful lot of people who do get it.

And there’s so many things happening with this government at the moment there is always just so much material.”<br><br>This particular video was created by splicing Holt’s footage with questions from a Sky News reporter to Boris Johnson in which he dodged questions about whether he had gone to the 20 May 2020 garden party (T0162.002: Edits Made to News Report which Reframe Context).</i> |

| [I00230 American Pickers' host Mike Wolfe is not in jail](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00230.md) | <i>In March and April 2025, videos surfaced on social media alleging — without any evidence to corroborate the claim — that Mike Wolfe, host of the History Channel TV show "American Pickers," had been arrested. The assertion was false (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>The rumor stemmed from videos uploaded by purported celebrity gossip channels on YouTube. The videos had titles like "Mike Wolfe Sentenced For Frank Frits's Death, Goodbye Forever," implying that Wolfe had been arrested (and charged, and sentenced) for the death of his former co-host, Frank Fritz. Fritz died on Sept. 30, 2024, according to an Instagram post Wolfe made the following day.<br><br>Artificial intelligence video-creation tools seemingly helped create the videos' narration, scripting, and sequencing (T0166: AI-Generated Content). Without naming an explicit source for its information, one video's narrator said:<br><br>“Mike Wolfe's sentencing stunned viewers across America when the "American Pickers" star was led away in handcuffs. Everyone thought his arrest was related to some dispute over antiques or perhaps a business disagreement with the History Channel. According to breaking news reports, Wolfe was arrested because the death of his former co-host, Frank Fritz, wasn't from natural causes as initially reported. Instead, investigators now classify it as premeditated murder. Medical reports indicate Fritz was found with lethal amounts of medication in his system. He was deliberately overdosed, and prosecutors grabbed Wolfe for the murder because it was calculated not accidental.”<br><br>That YouTube video had been viewed more than 272,000 times, as of this writing. Other YouTube videos sharing the same claim, or variations on it, also had large view counts. Posts on social media sites like Facebook also spread the supposed news.<br><br>There was no evidence to support the assertion that Wolfe had been arrested, and certainly no evidence he was arrested on charges of killing Fritz. If there was even a sliver of truth to the claim — for instance, if Wolfe had been arrested on different charges — reputable entertainment media outlets would have interviewed parties involved and documented the ordeal. That had not happened.<br><br>In short, the claim appeared to be made up from whole cloth for the purpose of gaining views online. A disclaimer at the bottom of the YouTube video read: <br><br>"Context of Information: The views and information shared in Niwra's videos are drawn from current news, reports, and personal insights. They are provided for educational and informational purposes only and may not always reflect the latest developments or offer a full perspective on the topics discussed."<br><br>Despite the fact that the video's underlying claim was false, the clip about Wolfe could seem believable because Fritz did die in September 2024, from the long-term effects of a stroke. Additionally, an unrelated Oregon man named Michael Wolfe was sentenced to life in prison in 2022 for murdering a woman and her child.<br><br>That small amount of truth inside a mountain of misleading information, combined with emotionally charged language, is a recipe that allows baseless celebrity rumors to go viral, and generate hundreds or thousands of comments from YouTube users. Some of those messages indicate that people interpret the videos to be real news.</i> |

| [I00239 “Deceptive” clickbait headlines: Relevance, intentions, and lies](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00239.md) | <i>2. Classic clickbaiting strategies<br><br>In Scott (2021: 54), clickbait was defined as “online content that is specifically designed to entice a reader to click on a link, but which offers very little reward for doing so”. (T0167.001: Use of Clickbait) When we click through and read a clickbait article, we are likely to feel disappointed. In relevance theory terms, the cognitive effects that we derive from reading the article are less than those we were promised, and we may feel that it has not been worth our while to do so.<br><br>The focus of much of the existing work on the pragmatics of clickbait has been on what Jodłowiec (2022:7) calls “classic” clickbait headlines. These are sensationalist and hyperbolic headlines which often use a formulaic structure, vocabulary, and style. These headlines entice readers to click by creating an information gap (Blom and Hansen, 2015; Scott, 2021). They imply that some relevant information exists, and they indicate that the readers will gain access to that information if they click through and read the article. The headlines in (3) to (8) are typical examples of this and they illustrate some techniques that are commonly used to create an information gap.<br><br>(3) These gadgets will make you believe in the future of food<br><br>(4) Now THIS is why I voted for Barack Obama<br><br>(5) This goat has been bullying his Tiger Friend<br><br>(6) 12 Mind-blowing ways to eat Polenta<br><br>(7) Which TV female friend group do you belong to?<br><br>(8) How intuitive are you really?<br><br>The headlines in (3) to (5) use proximal demonstrative pronouns (“these”, “this”) as referring expressions. The reader must click through to find out what “these gadgets”, “this goat” or “THIS” refers to. Furthermore, in (4), the use of upper-case letters encourages an emphatic or contrastive interpretation of “THIS” (Scott and Jackson, 2020; Scott, 2021). The reader will expect there to be something new, special, or particularly interesting about the reason the writer voted for Obama, but he must click through to find out what that unusual or special reason is. Headline (6) is a “listacle” (Temmerman and Vandenabeele, 2018) and uses a superlative (“mind-blowing”) to tempt the reader to click. The examples in (7) and (8) ask the readers a direct question, implying that if they click through, they will learn something relevant about themselves. Blom and Hansen (2015) discuss a range of other forward referring techniques and devices used in clickbait including imperatives, ellipsis, and implicit reference, and Chen et al. (2015) identify use of reverse narrative as a further technique for creating an information gap. In Scott (2021), it was demonstrated that there are a number of significant differences in the vocabulary used in these headlines when compared with non-clickbait headlines from traditional news publications. For example, there is a significant difference in the use of superlatives and intensifiers, and classic clickbaits also use forward-referring expressions such as demonstratives and personal pronouns more often than non-clickbait newspaper headlines.<br><br>Furthermore, headlines in traditional news media tend not to leave information gaps, but rather, they provide a summary of the associated story. As such, they function as autonomous texts (Dor, 2003; Ifantidou, 2009). Classic clickbait headlines are not autonomous in this way. They are dependent on the associated article, and the readers must click through if they are to form an understanding of the story or content of the article and fill the information gaps.<br><br>Some of the strategies used in clickbait (lists, questions, reverse narratives) and formulaic phrases (“You won't believe …”, “… and what happened next is unbelievable!”) have become red flags alerting users to the presence of clickbait. Furthermore, software for clickbait detection and avoidance tends to, at least partly, depend on the use of “clickbait language” to identify likely clickbait (Chen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Potthast et al., 2016, 2018). As users and software become more effective at recognising classic clickbait techniques, new strategies have emerged or become favoured. As Jodłowiec (2022: 14) puts it, authors of clickbait headlines are “trying hard to camouflage deception”. One such strategy that has emerged is the use of what Jodłowiec (2022) calls “deceptive clickbaits” (T0167.002: Title Misrepresents Content). In the next section, I outline the properties of deceptive clickbaits, following and building on Jodłowiec's analysis.<br><br>3. Deceptive clickbaits<br><br>On the surface, deceptive clickbaits appear much more like traditional headlines than the classic clickbaits that we saw in the previous section. Some examples of deceptive clickbaits are given in (9) to (11).<br><br>(9) The Polish national team coach dies (Popularne, discussed in Jodłowiec 2022:8)<br><br>(10) Alex Scott worries about sharing “too much information” in very candid health update (Beale, 2022)<br><br>(11) Chaos for Cheryl's West End debut as star pulls out and is replaced by Eastenders Legend (Domachowski, 2023)<br><br>The headline in (9) is an example discussed by Jodłowiec (2022), and the examples in (10) and (11) were collected from the Google Discover news feed and appeared in UK online tabloid newspapers. Each of these headlines appears to provide a summary of the accompanying story in a way that parallels traditional news headlines. These headlines function as autonomous texts, and we can form a hypothesis about the intended meaning and hence the content of the story, based on the headline alone.<br><br>Applying the relevance-theoretic interpretative processes (outlined in Section 1) to the deceptive clickbait headlines allows us to predict likely interpretations. To interpret the headline in (9) the reader must assign reference to the definite description “The Polish national team coach”. This headline appeared on a Polish news website and, as Jodłowiec points out, the most accessible interpretation is quite clearly the coach of the current Polish national men's soccer team. Such an interpretation would lead to cognitive effects for the Polish target audience, and the death of such a high-profile individual would be highly relevant to many readers. The audience is therefore likely to settle on this as the intended interpretation of the referring expression.<br><br>At this point, the headline appears to be functioning much like a traditional news headline. In Dor's (2003: 703) relevance-theoretic analysis of headlines he characterises them as optimising “the relevance of the story by minimizing processing effort while making sure that a sufficient amount of contextual effects are deducible within the most appropriate context possible”. That seems to be the case here. If the coach of the Polish national soccer team has died, then the headline in (9) appears to be an optimally relevant way to communicate this information to a national audience.<br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of the headline in (9) aligns with expectations that readers might have about the newsworthiness of stories in national news media. The optimally relevant interpretation of this headline has high news value in the sense outlined by Bednarek and Caple (2018). Stories with high news value tend to be negative, with impactful consequences, and significance from a human-interest perspective. They also tend to feature prominent individuals and they describe events which are both recent and geographically/culturally close to the experiences of the intended readership. The optimally relevant interpretation of the headline in (9) fulfils all these criteria and leads us to infer that the article contains more details about what would be a highly newsworthy story.<br><br>The classic clickbait headlines that we saw in Section 2 leave us with a gap that needs to be filled. We are unable to fully interpret the headline unless we fill that gap, and it is this that arouses our curiosity. With deceptive clickbaits, however, our curiosity is aroused precisely because our expectations of relevance lead us to a highly relevant, highly newsworthy interpretation and we want to know more. Why then might we consider these headlines deceptive? And why might they fall under the definition of clickbait?<br><br>While the way in which they arouse curiosity is different, like classic clickbait, the “deceptive” clickbait headlines are ultimately disappointing. As Jodłowiec discusses, when users click through, they find that their interpretation of the headline does not align with the content of the story in the full article. For example, the “Polish national coach” referred to in (9) is not the national men's soccer team coach. On reading the article, we discover that the story is about the much less well-known coach of the Polish junior volleyball team. The news value of this story is much lower. The individual concerned is less well known and while still a negative story with human-interest, far fewer cognitive effects will follow from this news than from the story that the reader was expecting.<br><br>In example (10) we have even more contrast between the optimally relevant interpretations of the headlines and the content of the stories that they accompany. The wording of the headline in (10) leads us to expect that the former England women's footballer Alex Scott has been given a worrying update about her health. This interpretation has high news value. It is negative and unexpected, and it is likely to lead to significant consequences. It would be a highly relevant story from which many cognitive effects would follow for the average readers of the publication in which it appears. However, when the readers click through the headline in (10), they find a report about an Instagram video posted by Scott. In the 16 s video she says “Guys, this may be a bit too much … TMI … but [laughs] … I am off for a colonic. My first colonic of 2022 [laughs]”. While this is strictly speaking a health update, it is a far more mundane and less newsworthy story than the readers have been led to believe.<br><br>Finally, the headline in (11) appeared after the first performances of a play in London's West End featuring the high-profile singer and celebrity Cheryl. To interpret the headline, the reader must infer who the “star” is who has pulled out and been replaced. Given the fact that she has just been mentioned and that her appearance in this production has been long anticipated, the most accessible and relevant referent for the referring expression “star” is Cheryl. This interpretation would justify the use of the word “chaos” to describe the opening night of the play, and it would represent a highly newsworthy story. If Cheryl had pulled out of the production many ticketholders would be left disappointed. However, when reading the full article, readers discover that it is in fact Cheryl's much less famous co-star Hugh Chegwin who has had to withdraw from the production due to illness.<br><br>Notice that in each of these cases, the actual stories are not entirely lacking in newsworthiness. Jodłowiec's example in (9) deals with a sad event with human interest. The story behind the headline in (10) is taken from a celebrity social media post. Presumably, the followers of this account would find this information interesting, and the fact that it is about a prominent figure gives it at least some news value. Finally, the news story behind the update in (11) may well be of interest to theatregoers and ticketholders. However, the success of online news headlines depends on large numbers of users clicking on the links to access the pages. To optimise revenue, the headlines must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Online headlines are competing for the user's attention with a wide array of other inputs. While the actual stories behind headlines like (10) may be relevant enough to attract the attention of a fan as they scroll through the Instagram feed of a favourite celebrity, they are unlikely to have the same effect when competing against high news value stories and other content such as advertisements. Similarly, while the headline in (11) may be relevant to those who are planning to see the play, the high news value “deceptive” interpretation has a much wider potential audience, comprising of anyone with any interest in Cheryl's activities or career.<br><br>The headlines in (10) and (11) appeared on the Google discovery news feed. They are designed to attract users’ attention when Google is opened on mobile devices. Presumably, the user has opened Google for a specific purpose such as running a search or checking for updates. To be successful, the headlines must seem more relevant than whatever the user was planning to do. According to relevance theory, our “attention tends automatically to go to what is most relevant at the time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2012: 6) and “[w]hat makes an input worth picking out from the mass of competing stimuli is not just that it is relevant, but that it is MORE relevant than any alternative input available to us at that time” (Wilson and Sperber, 2004: 609). Therefore, to attract the attention of a wide audience and to arouse curiosity in the members of that audience, the headlines need to present the associated article as likely to yield a wealth of cognitive effects for as many people as possible.<br><br>Of course, it is a function of all headlines to attract attention and to arouse interest (Iarovici and Amel, 1989; Ifantidou, 2009; Jodłowiec, 2022), and, as Ifantidou (2009: 700) discusses, they “consistently underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent” the news stories with which they are associated. For example, a study by Andrew (2007: 24) established that in headlines about politics there is “a considerable difference between articles and their headlines in terms of emphasis and issue salience”. Deceptive clickbait headlines, however, do not simply provide a different emphasis or focal point to the main article. They encourage the reader to retrieve an interpretation which is significantly at odds with the story described in the article. In her discussions, Jodłowiec (2022) provides a relevance-theoretic analysis of how such deceptive clickbait headlines do so.<br><br>As Jodłowiec (2022: 10) explains, with deceptive clickbait headlines, following the relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure leads readers to an interpretation that is “potentially rich in cognitive effects”. This is the interpretation with high news value. This interpretation turns out to be “incongruent with the content of the text” (p. 6) and the reader is left disappointed. Jodłowiec likens these headlines to jokes or puns where the hearer is led down one inferential path only to realise that another, often absurd interpretation is intended. Consider, for example, the joke in (12), where encyclopaedic information about goldfish (i.e., that they sometimes live in glass water tanks) makes one meaning of the word “tank” highly accessible. The punchline forces the hearer to reassess this disambiguation, as they realise that a different meaning is intended.<br><br>(12)	Two goldfish in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing?”<br><br>As Jodłowiec points out, while the mechanism may be similar, there are no humorous effects or “intellectual satisfaction associated with getting the punchline” (p. 15) for the victims of deceptive clickbait. There is only disappointment that their expectations have not been met and a feeling that their time and effort has been wasted or that they have been tricked or deceived.<br><br>According to Jodłowiec, however, these deceptive clickbait headlines are not lies. She follows Dynel's (Dynel, 2018) characterisation of what it means to lie, and argues that “Unlike lies, which are intended to produce a false belief in the target (Dynel, 2018:16), deceptive clickbaits merely misrepresent the content of the article by projecting a certain meaning which is later discovered to be unintended” (Jodłowiec, 2022:7). Furthermore, she suggests that “responsibility for recovering a certain meaning, though cleverly ‘engineered’ by the website editor, rests with the reader” (p. 15). In the rest of this paper, I will show that as least some deceptive clickbait headlines fall within existing definitions of what it means to be a lie. They mislead the reader at the explicit level, and they are intended to produce a false belief in the reader. Indeed, it is this false belief that drives the reader to click on the headline link. Furthermore, if we assume the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework of utterance interpretation, responsibility for the interpretation sits not with the reader, as Jodłowiec suggests, but firmly with the writers. This issue of where responsibility lies has consequences in terms of journalistic ethics and practices. For example, the United Kingdom independent regulator for newspapers and magazines (IPSO) Code of Practice specifies that, “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text” (IPSO, 2021). If responsibility for the interpretation of clickbait headlines is placed with the readers, then journalists have a clearer defence against accusations that they have breached the code by publishing “misleading” or “inaccurate” information. If we can show, however, that the deception is intentional, any defence is likely to be much less convincing.</i> |

| [I00247 ‘It was extremely pornographic’: Cara Hunter on the deepfake video that nearly ended her political career](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00247.md) | <i>When Cara Hunter, the Stormont politician, looks back on the moment she found out she had been deepfaked, she says it is “like watching a horror movie”. The setting is her grandmother’s rural home in the west of Tyrone on her 90th birthday, April 2022. “Everyone was there,” she says. “I was sitting with all my closest family members and family friends when I got a notification through Facebook Messenger.” It was from a stranger. “Is that you in the video … the one going round on WhatsApp?” he asked.<br><br>Hunter made videos all the time, especially then, less than three weeks before elections for the Northern Ireland assembly. She was defending her East Londonderry seat, campaigning, canvassing, debating. Yet, as a woman, this message from a man she didn’t know was enough to put her on alert. “I replied that I wasn’t sure which video he was talking about,” Hunter says. “So he asked, did I want to see it?” Then he sent it over.<br><br>“It was extremely pornographic,” she says. “I won’t go into detail but I want you to understand what I had to compute. Even as I’m sitting here talking about it now, I suddenly feel roasting hot. It’s a clip of a blue-walled bedroom, and it has American plugs. There’s this woman – a woman who seemed to have my face – who is doing a handstand and having mutual oral sex with a man. And I’m looking at this, sitting surrounded by family, in the middle of a very heated election campaign.” (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0166.002: Sexual Deepfake Impersonation, T0097.110: Party Official Persona, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis) At the same time, Hunter’s phone was blowing up with message after message from strangers who had seen the video. “All of them were just really vitriolic,” she says. “Those messages were from people who hate women.” (T0048: Harass)<br><br>It’s hard to fathom how unknown and “niche” deepfake pornography still was when this happened, only three years ago. “The only ‘altered images’ I really knew about at that time were Snapchat filters,” says Hunter. “My initial reaction was: ‘Is this a woman who looks similar to me?’ Then a friend asked if this could be one of those things where they put your face on to someone else’s body. We were Googling it, trying to see what it was called.” Since that time, this tech has come a frighteningly long way. “Now I have girls calling me, telling me this has happened to them and ruined their lives. Just recently, one young woman told me it had happened to her and 14 others, all when they were under 18,” she says. “Teachers tell me that they’ve seen a spike in nudification apps in schools (T0166.003: AI-Nudified Imagery). The affordability and accessibility has increased tenfold.”<br><br>In England and Wales, legislation is finally grappling with the issue – the Online Safety Act and the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 have made the sharing, creation and requesting of deepfake intimate image abuse illegal. In Northern Ireland, too, there are plans to criminalise it – the consultation process closed in October.<br><br>Yet it seems the public has been slow to grasp its harms. New police research, released last week, suggests one in four people still think there is nothing wrong with creating and sharing sexual deepfakes, or feel neutral about it. “I was shocked by that,” says Hunter. “This is a world where falsified, highly sexualised images can ruin your life, ruin your relationships, your reputation and career, and there are people who think: ‘It’s a bit of fun, it’s a bit of craic.’” She takes a long sigh. “I was shocked – but at the same time, not surprised. The normalisation of violence against women and girls cannot be overstated.”<br><br>For Hunter, who has just turned 30, the weeks after the video’s release were “horrific”. “I didn’t know what to do. Should I do a press release? Should I put a Facebook status out? You’re a young woman, 27 years old, and it was so hard to be taken seriously politically anyway.” Her party, the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP), advised her to ignore it. “Even recalling it now, I can’t believe this happened, but they said: ‘We’re two and a half weeks from an election. If you do a press release, your name will be right up there with words like ‘pornography’ – and people will see you through a sexual lens and also go looking for it.’ They said: ‘If 10,000 people know about that video now, 100,000 will know after you’ve drawn attention to it.’ Those numbers are burnt into my brain.”<br><br>Hunter then turned to the police, who informed her (apologetically) that no crime had been committed, and they didn’t have the technology or expertise to investigate anyway. It was Hunter who found the original video, with the original woman’s face, by using screenshots from it in reverse image search engines. When it came to identifying who had released the deepfake video on WhatsApp, she learned it was an encrypted platform whose users had the right to privacy. “I’d like to think I have a right for my life not to be ruined,” she says. “You’re one person up against the massive system of tech and coding.”<br><br>Many memories from that period still feel mortifying. Hunter’s uncle hammering at the door, having been shown the video by his friend. She had to invite him in, sit him down and explain that it wasn’t real. Then later, she had to explain it all again to her father.<br><br>“Everywhere I went, people I used to speak to would cross the road to avoid me,” she says. “I live in a beautiful coastal town that I’m lucky to represent. A mile from my house is a bar and, a couple of days after this happened, there was a party for a staff member’s birthday. I thought: ‘I can’t let it consume me. I’m going to go there and have a drink.’ On the way, a man approached me and asked me for oral sex. I kept going, reached the bar and there was complete silence when I walked in. I realised it was a mistake.”<br><br>Despite Hunter’s fear that silence would be viewed as evidence that the video was genuine, she followed the party’s advice and attempted to campaign as normal. “I remember saying to my boyfriend, who is now my husband: ‘I don’t care if I’m elected or not. I just want this to be over.’” As it turned out, Hunter won by just 14 votes – making her seat the most marginal in Northern Ireland.<br><br>[...]<br><br>She fears experiences like hers will deter young women from entering politics (T0139.003: Deter). “I have these very capable young girls on work experience in my office and I don’t want them to think this is part and parcel of the political experience,” she says. “Any time I ask a woman to consider standing, I have to ask three or four times. With men, nine out of 10 times, they’ll say yes straight away.”<br><br>There’s little doubt that the deepfake of Hunter directly affected the democratic process. How could it not have lost her votes? (T0139.001: Discourage) Women have been the first victims of this technology – a 2023 study found that 98% of online deepfakes are pornographic and that 99% of the targets are women. However, in this era Hunter terms “the AI Olympics”, the potential for future harms goes far beyond this. The deepfake of Joe Biden’s voice urging voters not to vote in the New Hampshire primary, or the video of Volodymyr Zelenskyy telling his troops to surrender are early examples. While the UK government has begun to tackle deepfake pornography, Danish authorities are attempting to go much further by changing copyright law. The proposed changes guarantee everyone’s right to their own body, facial features and voice. (Though the law would allow expressions of satire and parody.) “If we could bring that in here, I’d say ‘Hallelujah!’” says Hunter. “What we could also do – and what I’d really like to see – is a mandatory marking which shows on every AI video so everyone understands what they’re seeing.”<br><br>Beyond politics, Hunter still thinks about that video clip, that blue-walled bedroom, that upside-down woman, almost every day.<br><br>“Even now, I’m thinking: ‘Should I offer £500 to anyone with information on who did this?’” she says. “I need to understand. Is it personal? Is it that they hate me or is it that they hate women and don’t like to see a woman in power? Is it sectarian, because I’m a Catholic nationalist woman? Is it just that people maybe see me up there and think: ‘I’ll take her down a few pegs’?”</i> |

| [I00251 The Deepfake Porn Crisis Is Here](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00251.md) | <i>In June 2024, Guistolise was having dinner with friends when she received a call that changed everything. It was Samantha*, the ex-wife of Guistolise’s friend Ben, whom she had known for many years. Samantha said she needed to meet. Immediately.<br><br>When they spoke, Samantha shared with Guistolise that Ben had secretly been making deepfake pornographic images and videos of women, including Guistolise, using a “nudify” app, which takes real images and turns them into naked photos or videos using AI (T0166.003: AI-Nudified Imagery). There weren’t just a few images—there were hundreds, depicting 80 different women. And that’s just what Samantha was able to catalog and capture of what Ben had made over the course of a single week.<br><br>"It was me, but it wasn’t me,“ Guistolise tells Glamour about how she felt when she first saw the images. “It was so bizarre and dystopian and confusing.”<br><br>After learning about the deepfakes, Guistolise and her friends got to work identifying as many of the women as they could. Some of those women, in turn, helped identify others.<br><br>Each deepfake was created using screengrabs from the woman’s social media channels. Nudify apps (T0154.002: AI Media Platform) like the one Ben used typically only need one image of a person’s face to create a deepfake image. For Guistolise, it was from a photo taken at her goddaughter’s graduation and another from a family vacation, which she had posted to Facebook. This is a problem mostly faced by women, as the apps used to make nudify images aren’t trained to create images of the male form.<br><br>A year later, the women still haven’t been able to identify every single person in the images. They also haven’t seen any justice—the police officers they contacted said there is little they can do, even though Ben admitted to creating the images. And that’s because the laws around deepfake porn remains murky at best.<br><br>“This was not really something that had been on our radar,” says Omny Miranda Martone, the founder and CEO of the Sexual Violence Prevention Association (SVPA). “We’d been working on child abuse, sexual violence, and rape. We had not been working on any digital sexual violence until about three years ago.”<br><br>That changed when a victim came to them, sharing a story of how a rejected date at the gym turned into a man creating a deepfake of her and sharing it with her entire fitness community. When Martone asked the organization’s lawyers if there was more the survivor could do to protect herself, their answer was a resounding, “Not really.”<br><br>According to the lawyers, the act of creating that image and showing it to others didn’t constitute defamation because the man hadn’t been trying to pass it off as real. The victim wasn’t underage. And there was no law yet requiring social media platforms to take it down if he decided to distribute it. Still, SVPA knew that this was sexual violence. So Martone, their organization, and a few lawmakers got to work.<br><br>In May, President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by senators Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and endorsed by organizations like Martone’s and the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). The bill “prohibits the nonconsensual online publication of intimate visual depictions of individuals, both authentic and computer-generated,” and, critically, will require platforms like Instagram and Meta to take down the images if they receive notice of their existence within 48 hours.<br><br>“That one was a really big win,” Martone says of the bill, which goes into effect in 2026. Stefan Turkheimer, the vice president for public policy at RAINN, noted that this law protects everybody, whether or not the images are authentic or fake. It also doesn’t matter whether they were taken consensually or nonconsensually, as long as they were shared nonconsensually.<br><br>But this is where things get complicated: This law protects people against the dissemination of deepfakes or intimate images shared without their consent. There is little to nothing someone can do about a person—be it someone they know or a total stranger—making and keeping the deepfakes for themselves.<br><br>“It’s not enough,” says Guistolise of the Take It Down Act. While it’s certainly a step forward, Guistolise says it still requires people to find the content, which she likens to trying to “find a needle in a needle stack.” If and when victims do find it and report it, they must then wait 48 hours for it to be removed, revictimizing themselves in the process.<br><br>“Searching for your own fake porn is not something, mental-health-wise, I’m willing to do,” Guistolise says. And again, this is only if the perpetrator distributes images in the first place. What Guistolise and many advocates want, instead, is to make the technology to create these deepfake images illegal in the first place.<br><br>“There are all kinds of things that have been said about it, like, ‘We don’t wanna block innovation,’” Guistolise says. “But women’s and children’s bodies are being sacrificed on the altar of capitalism. This is not innovation. This is exploitation. There is no reason for it to exist other than making money off of apps.”<br><br>It’s an issue that is absolutely exploding. In 2023, Time reported on an analysis by Graphika that found 24 million people had visited “undressing websites” in the month of September alone. These nudify apps have also been advertised everywhere from Google to Reddit and across social platforms. In July, Wired reported that the apps are worth about $36 million thanks to paid users and free users, who pony up their personal data that is later sold to the highest bidder.<br><br>There is, however, a little hope on the horizon. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) along with Representative Laurel Lee (R-Fla.), Senator Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has reintroduced another bill known as the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Nonconsensual Edits Act (DEFIANCE Act). If passed, it will give victims the right to bring a civil action against “individuals who knowingly produce, distribute, solicit, and receive or possess with the intent to distribute nonconsensual sexually explicit digital forgeries.” This means victims would have the right to sue for damages, and it’s supported by both RAINN and the SVPA.<br><br>“We are reintroducing the DEFIANCE Act to grant survivors and victims of nonconsensual deepfake pornography the legal right to pursue justice,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. “I am proud to lead this legislation with Representative Lee, and senators Durbin and Graham, to provide victims with the federal protections they deserve.”<br><br>Elsewhere in the world, nations like Denmark are hoping to help protect people by passing legislation that gives everyone the copyright to their own likeness, including their voice. Our counterparts at Glamour UK lobbied tirelessly to change the law in the United Kingdom; it's now a criminal offense to create sexually explicit digital forgeries.<br><br>In Minnesota, Guistolise and the women in her group are working alongside state senator Erin Maye Quade and the state’s Senate Judiciary and Public Safety Committee on a potential bill that would outlaw nudification, requiring AI companies to disable the function that allows it to create the images, or fine them up to $500,000 for each nonconsensual deepfake.<br><br>“For these AI-generated photos and videos, the harm begins at creation,” Quade told MPR News. “Dissemination currently in Minnesota of nonconsensual, sexual deepfakes is illegal. But they can download these apps on their phones, and they’re doing that. They’re nudifying their teachers, their classmates, their siblings, friends.”<br><br>These laws, however common sense they may feel, will still face an upward battle. In May the Elon Musk–owned platform X sued the state of Minnesota over its law banning the creation of deepfakes to influence an election, which it said violated free speech. In August, Musk won a similar lawsuit against the state of California for its deepfake ban.<br><br>For Guistolise, this event has caused immeasurable pain. She’s lost trust in others. She’s afraid of how this may affect her future and her career. However, there is a “next” for her. She gets to go on being the sister and friend she’s always been. She’s excited to go to work tomorrow. She’s training her pitbull puppy, whom she appropriately named Olivia Benson, how to give a high five. And despite it all, “I love humans,” she says, before pausing. “I guess I still do.”</i> |
