| [I00134 Video does not show Palestinians pretending to be dead](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00134.md) | <i>A video circulating on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) showing a row of people lying under what appear to be shrouds, while occasionally moving, has been shared alongside captions suggesting these are Palestinians pretending to have died in the recent Israel-Gaza conflict.<br><br>However this footage is actually from a 2013 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current) student protest (T0162: Reframe Context) in Cairo, Egypt (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location).<br><br>In the video, the camera pans over multiple people lying in a row under what appear to be white shrouds, which have messages written on them in Arabic. Over the course of the video, multiple people can be seen to move under the shrouds. Someone off-camera removes the cloth from the face of a man who appears to laugh. <br><br>The text of the video shared on Facebook says “Wake up world/They think you are fools! The masters of fake news/ Welcome the palestinians [sic] & their Hamas” (T0162: Reframe Context), while the caption states “Dude, stop moving” and is accompanied by the hashtags “#standwithisrael”, “HamasisISIS” and “pallywood”. (T0015.001: Use Existing Hashtag)<br><br>This latter phrase is a portmanteau of Palestine and Bollywood used by some to describe the alleged false staging of images or videos to portray Palestinian victimhood. Full Fact has written about this term before after it was included in several misleading posts online. <br><br>This video was not taken recently (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current), or in Gaza or the West Bank (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location), and does not show Palestinians. <br><br>The watermark in the top right corner of the video says ‘Al-Badil’ in Arabic, which was an Egyptian news service. The same video and watermark is evident in this original version of the video, which was uploaded to the organisation’s YouTube channel on 28 October 2013. <br><br>The caption (translated with Google) says the video shows Muslim Brotherhood students at Al-Azhar University in Cairo. In October 2013, students at the university undertook multiple protests, demanding the reinstatement of Mohammed Morsi as President of Egypt after he was deposed by the military in July 2013. <br><br>This video has been used multiple times to falsely claim (T0160.002: Information is False) that deaths are being staged in various conflicts (T0162: Reframe Context): in 2016, the title of this video suggests the people are “victims” of “Russian bombings” faking their deaths; in 2017 and 2018 social media posts suggested this video showed apparent “Victims of [Syrian President] Assad’s chemical attack” or “living corpses in Syria after the poison gas attack”; and in 2021 it was claimed that the video showed Palestinians “posing” as “corpses” (T0160.006: Content Previously Fact Checked).</i> |
| [I00135 Hamas Attacks, Israel Bombs Gaza and Misinformation Surges Online](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00135.md) | <i>Misinformation has been spreading rapidly online ever since Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7. At least 1,000 people were killed and the Islamist militant group took between 100 and 150 hostages. Israel retaliated, threatening a complete siege of Gaza and hitting the area with multiple airstrikes, killing more than 900 people. <br><br>[...]<br><br>During breaking news events, there is often uncertainty about the claims we see on social media. As we discuss in our 2021 guide, determining when a video was filmed is an essential part of debunking dis- and misinformation. <br><br>We have identified multiple examples of footage being reused from past conflicts and military events as evidence of current events in Israel-Palestine (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current, T0160.002: Information is False).  <br><br>For example, the video below, filmed at night, depicts multiple rockets being fired in quick succession, which is being circulated with the claim that they were fired at Israel by Hamas. While the video shows military activity, it does not show its impact or target.<br><br>[Here, Bellingcat provides a collection of three screenshots, two showing posts made to TikTok (T0151.008: Microblogging Platform), the first captioned “BREAKING NEWS Hamas just Fired hundreds of rockets towards israel iron dome stopped working #IsraelPalestineWar” (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), the second captioned “Israel under attack… #israel #hamas #usa🇺🇸 #nowar #warzone”. The third screenshot is a post made to X by a verified account controlled by the leader of Britain First, a political party and hate group (T0146.003: Verified Account Asset, T0097.110: Party Official Persona, T0143.001: Authentic Persona). The post contains the video with the text “Rockets being fired at the Israel capital Tel Aviv”]<br><br>However, the video is at least three years old, as it was uploaded to YouTube in February 2020 by a Russian-speaking account whose name translates as ‘World on the Brink.’ </i> |
| [I00137 Old cremation video in Vietnam unrelated to Taiwanese celebrity's death](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00137.md) | <i>After Taiwanese star Barbie Hsu died from pneumonia during a vacation in Japan over the Lunar New Year holiday, social media users falsely claimed a video shared thousands of times was filmed at her cremation ceremony in Japan. But the clip was taken in a Vietnamese crematorium in December 2024 and has no connection to Hsu (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current, T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location, T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). <br><br>"Barbie Hsu cremated in Japan today. It makes me cry for her children who were orphaned," reads the caption of a Facebook video shared on February 4 in a mix of English and Tagalog. <br><br>The 59-second video shows mourners -- including kids -- weeping as they watch a brown coffin being sent into a cremator. <br><br>Overlaid text on the video says: "It's heartbreaking, Barbie's children are still so young."<br><br>It was shared over 4,600 times before it was deleted and has spread on Instagram, Threads, YouTube and TikTok alongside similar claims. <br><br>Taiwanese star Barbie Hsu, who was hugely popular across Asia for her leading role in the 2001 television drama "Meteor Garden", died from a respiratory illness on February 2. She was 48 (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). <br><br>Hsu passed away after developing pneumonia during a family trip to Japan over the Lunar New Year holiday, the younger of her two sisters was quoted as saying. <br><br>The urn containing Hsu's ashes was flown back to Taiwan from Tokyo's Haneda Airport on February 5, according to Singaporean news outlet The Straits Times.  <br><br>But the circulating video has nothing to do with her death (T0160.002: Information is False). <br><br>Taken in Vietnam<br><br>Keyword searches found the video surfaced on TikTok on December 29, 2024 -- months before Hsu's death (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current). <br><br>At the four-second mark of the TikTok video, Vietnamese text can be seen on the television screen above the cremator's metal door. AFP's bureau in Vietnam confirmed the name of the deceased on the screen did not belong to Hsu. <br><br>Subsequent Google reverse image searches led to similar footage posted on TikTok on December 30, 2024 by a user who identifies himself as Pham Son Hai and a worker at the Hoa Lac Vien crematorium in Vietnam (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location). <br><br>It contains several elements seen in the false video, including the television screen, the cremation chamber number, the casket design and the yellow statuette on the table. <br><br>When shown the circulating Facebook video, Pham told AFP on February 11: "The user posted the wrong thing. This is the Hoa Lac Vien crematorium of Long Thanh, Dong Nai, Vietnam". </i> |
| [I00138 Images of Syrian Civil War Take on a Second Life in Gaza Conflict](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00138.md) | <i>[Bellingcat has] identified a trend of footage and images from Syria’s long-running civil war being recycled and misattributed to the [2023] Israel-Hamas conflict (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current, T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location). This phenomenon has also been reported by other outlets including The New York Times.  In particular, a number of prominent figures who have a history of denying the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attacks have re-shared Syrian civil war images, claiming they show Israel and Gaza. <br><br>[...]<br><br>The far-right US influencer Jackson Hinkle has quickly emerged as one of the most popular users on X during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. [...] Some of the imagery Hinkle has claimed to show Palestine was actually taken in Syria. For example, on November 12, he shared an image of a woman holding a toy car descending stairs with exposed walls and damaged infrastructure. He captioned this image “You CANNOT BREAK the Palestinian spirit.” (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis).<br><br>However, this photo was featured in the Siena International photography competition in 2020. It was taken by the Iranian photographer Hassan Ghaedi, who won an award for the image in the competition’s documentary and photojournalism category. According to AFP’s Fact Check, which cited Ghaedi’s social media accounts, the image was taken in 2016 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current) and shows a woman returning to a destroyed building in Homs, Syria (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location).<br><br>On November 1, Olga Robinson of BBC Verify reported that Hinkle had shared a video he claimed to be footage of Gaza’s Al-Sadaqa Hospital being bombed by Israel (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis). This video depicted civilians in a hospital and a subsequent bombing and was also shared widely on X.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The clip shared by Hinkle, in fact, is an excerpt from a video that shows the bombing of the Omar Bin Abdul Aziz Hospital in Aleppo, Syria from the perspective of those inside (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location). As the Guardian reported at the time, this attack came during a 2016 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current) surge of bombing raids by Syrian regime forces and their Russian allies. The attack on the hospital was condemned by the World Health Organization (WHO).<br><br>The video is credited to the Aleppo Media Center (AMC), a Middle Eastern Independent documentary film production company. It is one of hundreds on AMC’s YouTube channel to document attacks in Syria by Syrian government forces. The relevant scene in the hospital can be seen from timestamp 00:40 (T0165.001: Clipped Content).<br><br>In the recent viral version of the video shared by Hinkle, the AMC logo had been cropped out (T0165.002: Cropped Content, T0165.004: Source Edited Out of Content).</i> |
| [I00140 Old video from Iraq shared as 'Israeli soldiers firing at mosque in Gaza'](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00140.md) | <i>A video showing gunshots and smoke emanating from a minaret is being shared with the claim that it depicts Israeli soldiers firing at a mosque in Gaza during prayer. Social media users shared the video with captions such as, "Israeli soldiers fired on a mosque minaret in Gaza while the Adhan (call to prayer) was being recited (translated from Arabic)."<br><br>However, we found that the video actually shows U.S. Marines firing at a mosque in Iraq (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location).<br><br>A reverse image search revealed the video was posted on American filmmaker Michael Moore's YouTube channel on March 16, 2008. (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current The video was captioned, "WINTER SOLDIER: U.S. Marines Fire on Mosques Unprovoked." <br><br>The description read, "Cpl. Jon M. Turner's (3/8 Kilo Company, 1st Platoon, U.S. Marine Corps) testimony on March 15, 2008, included these two videos of Turner's squad firing on Mosques unprovoked, a violation of international law."<br><br>A September 2011 YouTube video features former U.S. Marine Jon Turner discussing his time in Iraq. Beginning around the 14:20 mark, Turner describes an incident involving a minaret, stating, "One of the guys in the weapons company had gotten shot, and this is the way we would take out our aggression." The viral video appears on a projector screen at 14:28.<br><br>Turner adds, "For those of you who don't know, it is illegal to shoot into a mosque unless you were taking fire from it. There was no fire that was taken from that mosque. It was shot into because we were angry."</i> |
| [I00169 Fake subtitles show Putin and Erdogan ‘warning America’ over Israel support](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00169.md) | <i>Videos being shared online falsely claim to show Russia’s President Putin and Turkey’s President Erdogan “warn America” about its support of Israel. <br><br>The two videos show footage of the leaders speaking in Russian and Turkish, with English subtitles. However, the footage predates recent conflict in October 2023 (T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current) and the subtitles do not translate what the politicians actually said (T0162.001: Incorrect Subtitled Speech Reframes Context, T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>[...]<br><br>One video shows President Putin supposedly saying: “America wants to destroy Israel. As we destroy Ukraine in past. I am warning America. Russia will help Palestine and America can do nothing [sic].”<br><br>[...]<br><br>A USA Today logo is visible in the top corner of some versions of the videos but the subtitles are not in the media company’s traditional colours or style (T0162.002: Edits Made to News Report which Reframe Context). Some versions of the video feature a flashing red dot to give the impression it was recorded live.<br><br>Thousands of people have also viewed a video of President Erdogan appearing to say: “I am warning America don’t in Israel Palestine war. We are with our innocent Palestinian brother’s. We are ready to defend Palestine at any price [sic].”<br><br>[...]<br><br>The videos both use old footage of the politicians which predate current events in the Middle East, and show mistranslated subtitles. <br><br>The clip of President Putin actually shows him during a meeting with the country’s ‘Council for Civil Society and Human Rights’ in December 2022, and there’s no mention of Israel or Palestine in the subtitles from USA Today or in the transcript for the whole meeting released by the Kremlin. Media reports from the time don’t mention him saying this either.<br><br>The video of President Erdogan was published by news website Middle East Eye in July 2023 with the publication’s logo appearing in the clip on social media (T0162.002: Edits Made to News Report which Reframe Context, T0162.003: Historic Content Incorrectly Presented as Current, T0162.001: Incorrect Subtitled Speech Reframes Context, T0160.002: Information is False). While he is speaking in Turkish about relations with Israel and “the Palestinian state”, the subtitles show there is no reference to America. </i> |
