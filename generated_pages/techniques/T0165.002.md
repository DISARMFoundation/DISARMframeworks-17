# Technique T0165.002: Cropped Content

**Summary**: This sub-technique can be used to document Image or Video content which zooms in on a section of the original media, cropping content on the outer edges of the frame, without disclosure.<br><br>Actors have been observed cropping media in such a way that removes its original context, allowing for a creation of a new narrative. For example, a wide angle shot showing a person holding a sign at a counter-protest could be cropped to remove the sign, allowing for a new narrative that they were part of the original protest.<br><br>To make this assessment, analysts will need to find the original unedited content, and identify the section which matches the published cropped content.
