# Technique T0168.006: Narrative Uses Leading Question

**Summary**: Leading questions are a manipulative questioning technique where the phrasing or sequence of questions subtly steers the respondent toward a predetermined conclusion. Instead of neutrally seeking information, the questioner embeds assumptions, implications, or emotional cues that make certain answers seem more acceptable or obvious.<br><br>To make the assertion that a narrative is using leading questions can be based on several rhetorical methods: bias present in the words (eg. saying “smashed” instead of “hit”), use of assumptions that are inbuilt (eg. when did you stop stealing roadsigns) or the use of a tag at the end to solicit agreement (eg. you did eat all of my pancakes, didn’t you?). Many leading questions can be answered through a yes or a no answer (eg. my pancakes were delicious, weren’t they?).
