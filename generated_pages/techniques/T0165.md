| [I00214 False: An Italian news channel used visuals from the film Deep Impact to depict an exodus of people from Kyiv.](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00214.md) | <i>Since Russia invaded Ukraine, misinformation relating to the conflict has spread. A recent tweet claimed that media outlets were using clips from the movie Deep Impact to report the war. The tweet compared two similar images which show people running on a highway packed with cars. One image had text which said Deep Impact, and the other with the logo of TGcom24, an Italian news channel, with the text "Escape from Kiev."<br><br>After analyzing TGcom24's reports of Ukraine and Russia, it is clear that the news channel did not use footage from the movie. After comparing the image from the tweet with video footage from TGcom24, Logically found that the image is altered (T0165: Edited Content). The logo in the tweet is hazy and pixelated. The logo's format and placement were also different in the tweet. Official footage from TGcom24 shows their logo usually on the bottom right of the screen and not on the top right (T0161.001: Impersonated Content).<br><br>We could not find where this edited image first appeared through a reverse image search. Most results showed stock images from the movie. The Twitter post in question was made on June 19, 2022. TGcom24 has never published any reports using the image in question.<br><br>The image in the tweet has been digitally altered to appear as though TGcom24 used a still from the film Deep Impact. There are no reports from the Italian news outlet that includes this image. Hence we have marked this claim as false (T0160.002: Information is False).</i> |

There are scores of identical photos on the web which containe different advertisements on the billboards.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Kremlin media and social media users are spreading claims that anti-Ukrainian billboards have appeared in Poland. As evidence, a photograph of a billboard is attached (T0161.003: Falsified Graffiti or Signage), which depicts the legs of a man in military garb with a prosthesis against the background of the Ukrainian and Russian flags and the inscription “This is not our war.”<br><br> “They want to develop this campaign throughout Poland by placing billboards. This is how the authorities want to influence the thinking of local residents who support Ukraine in the Special Military Operation,” writes Pravda.ru, and points out that the prosthetic leg on the billboard is featured over the Ukrainian flag.<br><br>StopFake factcheckers decided to check the authenticity of the photo featured on Pravda.ru. The image was was edited in a photo editor (T0165: Edited Content, T0162.008: Context Reframed by Edits to Media). A TinEye reverse photo search showed that there are many photos of this billboard on the Internet, taken from an identical angle, but with different advertisements on the billboard.<br><br>After a little online searching, we found the site [...] which allows you to insert any image on this billboard for free. The fact that this particular photo was used to create a fake about alleged “anti-Ukrainian advertising” in Poland is evidenced by the identical placement of cars and clouds in the doctored fake Russian photo, as in the distributed stock photo.</i> |

The driver of the Ferrari lost control of the car and hit the protective barriers while passing by the Wyrzysk bypass on S10 road on February 11, 2022.</i> |
