| [I00246 I was deepfaked by my best friend'](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00246.md) | <i>In the spring of 2021, Jodie (not her real name) was sent a link to a porn website from an anonymous email account.<br><br>Clicking through, she found explicit images (T0086: Develop Image-Based Content, T0166.002: Sexual Deepfake Impersonation) and a video (T0087: Develop Video-Based Content, T0166.002: Sexual Deepfake Impersonation) of what appeared to be her having sex with various men. Jodie's face had been digitally added onto another woman's body - known as a "deepfake". <br><br>Someone had posted photos of Jodie's face on a porn site saying she made them feel "so horny" and asking if other users on the site could make fake pornography of her. In exchange for the fakes, the user offered to share more photos of Jodie and details about her (T0048.004: Dox).<br><br>Speaking for the first time about her experience, Jodie, who is now in her mid-20s, says, "I was screaming and crying and violently scrolling through my phone to work out what I was reading and what I was looking at."<br><br>She adds: "I knew that this could genuinely ruin my life."<br><br>Forcing herself to scroll through the porn site, Jodie said she felt her "whole world fall away".<br><br>[...]<br><br>It was not the first time Jodie had been targeted.<br><br>In fact, it was the culmination of years of anonymous online abuse.<br><br>When Jodie was a teenager, she discovered that her name and photos were being used on dating apps without her consent (T0146: Account Asset, T0151.017: Dating Platform, T0143.003: Impersonated Persona).<br><br>This went on for years and she even received a Facebook message from a stranger in 2019 who said he was due to meet her at Liverpool Street station in London for a date. <br><br>She told the man that it wasn't her who he had been speaking to. She says she felt "unnerved" because he knew all about who she was and had managed to find her online. He'd found her on Facebook after the "Jodie" on the dating app had stopped responding. <br><br>In May 2020, during the UK's lockdown, Jodie was also alerted by a friend to a number of Twitter accounts that were posting pictures of her, with captions implying she was a sex worker. <br><br>"What would you like to do with little teen Jodie?" read one caption next to an image of Jodie in a bikini, which had been taken from her private social media account.<br><br>The Twitter handles posting these images had names like "slut exposer," and "chief perv."<br><br>All of the images being used were ones she'd been happy to share on her social media with close friends and family - but no one else.<br><br>Then she found that these accounts were also posting images of other women she knew from university, as well as from her hometown of Cambridge.<br><br>"In that moment, I feel a very strong sense [that] I'm at the centre of this and this person is looking to hurt me," she said.</i> |
