| [I00163 Visuals from a 2022 movie shoot shared with false ‘Pallywood' narrative](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00163.md) | <i>A video being shared on social media shows a boy lying on a table under some wooden blocks with two people approaching him and laughing as they pick him up. Sharing the video, users have alleged that people in Gaza, who are facing regular bombardment from Israel, are faking injuries amid the ongoing conflict. Archived versions of posts sharing the video with such claims can be viewed here, here, and here. <br><br>Several accounts have shared the viral visuals with the hashtag ‘Pallywood’, a narrative that became popular among a section of social media users amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, which alleges that Palestinians are faking injuries, deaths, and funerals. The dehumanizing narrative is not new; an analysis by Logically Facts found a surge in such posts aimed at denying and mocking civilian harm on the Palestinian side since the conflict that began on October 7, 2023.<br><br>However, the now-viral clip depicts behind-the-scenes (BTS) footage of a movie that was shot in 2022. It does not depict ‘crisis actors’ allegedly staging deaths or injuries in Gaza (T0162.010: Entertainment Media Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality).<br><br>A reverse image search of a screenshot from the viral clip led us to a video uploaded on TikTok  by an account named ‘Mahmoud Maher Zaqout’ on February 15, 2022. According to his bio, Zaqout is a Palestinian director and photographer. We can see the now-viral visuals in this video, with overlaid Arabic text that translated to “A new movie” (translated to English). A comment posted by the creator below the video added that it shows the filming of a movie.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The movie ‘Al-Ahed’ was uploaded on Zaqout’s official Instagram account on March 1, 2022. There are various similarities between the film’s visuals and the BTS footage posted by Zaqout on TikTok.</i> |
| [I00164 Video of ‘actor in Gaza limping on the wrong foot’ is from comedy skit filmed in Iraq](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00164.md) | <i>A video is circulating on social media alongside claims it shows an actor in Gaza who is accidentally limping on the wrong foot. <br><br>The posts say the actor “pretends to be a ‘victim’” and that “the media is lying to us about what's happening in Gaza. Why would they need to act if there was an actual genocide?”<br><br>But the video actually shows a comedy skit (T0162.010: Entertainment Media Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality, T0162.011: Content Originally Produced as Satire Presented as Not Satire) filmed in Baghdad, Iraq (T0162.004: Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Another Location), which was uploaded to Instagram on 8 December. It is unrelated to the current conflict in the Middle East.<br><br>That account appears to belong to a shop selling cleaning products, cosmetics and electrical items and its Instagram bio lists its location as an address in Baghdad, Iraq. Searching images of the Bab al-Derwaza Market mentioned in the bio, Full Fact was able to find a picture which matched the buildings and street signs in the back of the video, confirming it was filmed at this location in Iraq, not Gaza. The original video’s caption makes no mention of Gaza or Palestinians.<br><br>In a later post commenting on the video’s spread, and misattribution to Gaza, the account holder confirms the video was filmed in Baghdad and questions why the video ended up being wrongly connected to Gaza. <br><br>The fact that the video is being shared with captions suggesting the man in it is an actor in Gaza pretending to be a victim appears to echo a narrative, often referred to as ‘Pallywood’ (a portmanteau of Palestine and Bollywood), which has been used online to describe the alleged false staging of harm to Palestinian civilians.</i> |
| [I00165 Video of ‘Rafah actors’ actually from Palestinian TV drama series](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00165.md) | <i>A video is being shared online with the implication that it shows “Rafah actors” preparing to pretend to be dead or injured in Gaza. This comes amidst reports Israel appears to be set to launch a large-scale assault on the city in the south of Gaza.<br><br>In the clip, which is circulating on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, and shared over 4,000 times on X (formerly Twitter), a man lies on a stretcher while a woman applies makeup to his chest and neck, and another man sits in what appears to be a body bag—while smoking a cigarette. <br><br>Text overlaid on the video says “Make-up Gaza Style” and has a watermark of an account which shares what it claims are “Pallywood” videos—a portmanteau of Palestine and Bollywood. <br><br>Full Fact has written several times about this term, which in some cases has been previously used to caption videos or images incorrectly claiming to show those in Gaza faking images of harm to civilians during the war. <br><br>A caption with one post sharing the video on Facebook says: “Rafah actors are preparing, and we may soon witness disturbing footage from Rafah.”<br><br>But this video actually shows behind-the-scenes footage of a Palestinian drama series, called Bleeding Dirt (T0162.010: Entertainment Media Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality), and is unrelated to Israel’s planned military offensive in Rafah (T0160.002: Information is False).<br><br>The actors in the clip being shared can be seen in the same makeup and costume during an episode of the show, available online. The description with the video says it premiered on 12 March 2024. <br><br>According to Palestinian fact checkers Kashif, the scene was filmed in a town near Nablus, in the West Bank, not Gaza.</i> |
