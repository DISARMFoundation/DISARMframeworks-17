# Technique T0162.005: Video Game Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality

**Summary**: Modern game visuals or cutscenes can be realistic enough to be mistaken for genuine imagery, particularly footage depicting fast-moving or chaotic scenes (such as combat). For example, fact checkers have addressed claims where footage taken from games centred on armed warfare (e.g. Arma 3, Digital Combat Simulator World) being presented as footage of current conflicts. <br><br>To make this assertion, analysts need to confirm that the original source for a piece of content was a video game, and that the content was presented as showing real life (e.g. posted alongside text which treats or reacts to the content as legitimate).<br><br>Indicators include frame rate artifacts, unnatural physics, or gaming interface remnants.

Vitriol, an expert in conspiracy theories and professor at Lehigh University, said in a phone interview.<br><br>“What it focuses on is the expectation that the government will create a false narrative or a false flag of an alien-type invasion or some big event,” he said. “Project Blue Beam is saying this clip is fake, and the government is using this fake event as part of a broader attempt to implement a New World Order.”<br><br>The social media clip was first shared by TikTok user @iceman_fox1 with the caption: “BREAKING: Three UFO's are intercepted by USAF F-22 Raptors over the central Nevada desert”.<br><br>An identical clip can be seen on the @iceman_fox1’s Instagram page.
