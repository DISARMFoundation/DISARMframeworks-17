# Technique T0152.008: Live Streaming Platform

**Summary**: Twitch.tv and Whatnot are examples of Live Streaming Platforms. <br><br>Live Streaming Platforms allow people to create Accounts and stream live content (video or audio). A temporary open Group Chat is created alongside live streamed content for viewers to discuss the stream. Some Live Streaming Platforms allow users to archive streamed content for later non-live viewing.<br><br>The ability to stream live media is not exclusive to Live Streaming Platforms; many online platforms allow users with Accounts to stream content (such as the Video Platform YouTube’s “YouTube Live”, and the Social Media Platform Facebook’s “Facebook Live”). However, Live Streaming Platforms’ primary purpose is to be a place for people to stream content live.

| [I00124 Malign foreign interference and information influence on video game platforms: understanding the adversarial playbook](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00124.md) | <i>The unique aspect of Operation Overload is a barrage of emails sent to newsrooms and fact-checkers across Europe. The authors of these messages urge recipients to verify content allegedly found online. The email subject lines often include an incitement to verify the claims briefly described in the message body. This is followed by a short list of links directing recipients to posts on Telegram, X, or known pro-Russian websites, including Pravda and Sputnik. <br><br>We have collected 221 emails sent to 20 organisations. The organisations mostly received identical emails urging them to fact-check specific false stories, which demonstrates that the emails were sent as part of a larger coordinated campaign.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The authors of the emails do not hide their intention to see the fake content widely spread. In February 2024, a journalist at the German outlet CORRECTIV engaged with the sender of one of the emails, providing feedback on the narratives which were originally sent. CORRECTIV received a response from the same Gmail address, initially expressing respect and trust in CORRECTIV’s assessment, while asking: “is it possible for your work to be seen by as many people as possible?”, thereby clearly stating the goal of the operation.<br><br>[...]<br><br>All the emails come from authors posing as concerned citizens. All emails are sent with Gmail accounts, which is typical for personal use. This makes it challenging to identify the individuals behind these emails, as anyone can open a Gmail account for free. The email headers indicate that the messages were sent from the Gmail interface, not from a personal client which would disclose the sender’s IP address.</i><br><br>In this example, threat actors used gmail accounts (T0146.001: Free Account Asset, T0097.100: Individual Persona, T0143.002: Fabricated Persona, T0153.001: Email Platform) to target journalists and fact-checkers, with the apparent goal of having them amplify operation narratives through fact checks. |
