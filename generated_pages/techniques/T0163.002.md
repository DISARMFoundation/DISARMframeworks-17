# Technique T0163.002: Narrative Misrepresents Findings of Cited Academic Research

**Summary**: A narrative makes a claim, and points to academic research to back up the legitimacy of the claim - however, the research does not actually support the claim, and is misrepresented as doing so.<br><br>It could be the case that individuals make an honest mistake believing the research supports their claim. However, some actors intentionally misrepresent the findings of a cited source relying on readers not checking the source. The issue of misrepresented research also occurs when AI is used to write materials, which may confidently summarise research in a way which does not capture important nuance or details in a report.<br><br>To count as a citation, the content must explicitly point to a specific piece of academic research to support a claim. This could be via an embedded link, footnotes, or providing the name of a paper, the journal it appears in, and the researchers who produced it.<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts may contact the original author of the research and ask whether their work has been accurately characterised in the claim, or they may read the research and assess themselves how well it supports the claim.

| [I00176 Japanese study misrepresented in posts claiming “heart failure surges among Covid-vaccinated”](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00176.md) | <i>In February 2025, viral social media posts appeared, claiming that “Japan sounds alarm as heart failure surges among Covid-vaccinated”. These posts shared what appeared to be a screenshot of an article’s headline. One example was posted by the Facebook page KAG Save America 2024, which received more than 17,000 user engagements and more than 10,000 shares. Another example was this TikTok video, viewed more than 209,000 times.<br><br>The link shown in the image takes one to this study, published in the Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy, titled “SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis: An analysis of the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database”.<br><br>We were unable to find an article carrying the same headline shown in these posts, but we did find this article by Slay News, published on 18 January 2025, with a similar headline: “Japan Sounds Alarm as Heart Failure Surges 4900% Among Covid-Vaxxed”. This article also referenced the same study.<br><br>The Slay News article was shared on X by accounts with large followings, such as Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the Los Angeles Times who’s endorsed U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary nominee RFK Jr.; Jim Ferguson, a former candidate for the Brexit Party in the 2019 UK General Elections who’s spread vaccine misinformation; and Mary Talley Bowden, an otolaryngologist who spread COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation.<br><br>But the study doesn’t support the claim (T0163.002: Narrative Misrepresents Findings of Cited Academic Research), and the scientific evidence shows that on balance, COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of complications from the disease, including heart complications. We explain below.<br><br>What did the study do and what did it find?<br><br>The study examined the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database, which is the Japanese equivalent of the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Like VAERS, this database collects information about adverse events occurring after vaccination. And like VAERS, a report alone isn’t sufficient evidence that a vaccine caused an adverse event.<br><br>Examining data from April 2004 to December 2023, the researchers found 880,999 adverse event reports following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, of which 1,846 were myocarditis and 761 were pericarditis. The data showed that most affected individuals were male and aged 30 years or below. The period between vaccination to onset of symptoms was eight days and below. These findings are consistent with that of previous studies that found an association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and myocarditis.<br><br>The researchers concluded that “In the Japanese population, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination was significantly associated with the onset of myocarditis/pericarditis […] although most adverse events occurred early after vaccination, overall outcomes were good”. The study didn’t report any alarming trends, contrary to the implications in the posts.<br><br>Study didn’t look at heart failure; benefits of vaccines outweigh their risks<br><br>Contrary to the claim in the posts, the study was unrelated to heart failure, a condition in which the heart no longer pumps blood as well as it should. Myocarditis, on the other hand, is inflammation of the heart muscle, and it isn’t the same as heart failure. Heart failure can be a complication of myocarditis, but it’s important to note that myocarditis associated with COVID-19 vaccination is typically mild. Most patients go on to make a full recovery after rest and medication.<br><br>Furthermore, the study didn’t account for whether affected individuals had COVID-19 or other viral infections before developing myocarditis. This is important because one of the most common causes of myocarditis is infection by a virus, like those that cause the flu and the common cold. This is one reason the study cannot reliably assess whether myocarditis cases were actually caused by the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.<br><br>Studies have shown that compared to COVID-19 vaccination, COVID-19 is associated with a greater risk of myocarditis, along with other complications like blood clots. The American Heart Association considers the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines to outweigh their risks. An expert consensus by the American College of Cardiology found that “a very favorable benefit-to-risk ratio exists with the COVID-19 vaccine for all age and sex groups evaluated thus far”.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Social media posts misrepresent a Japanese study about adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination (T0163.002: Narrative Misrepresents Findings of Cited Academic Research), falsely claiming it showed heart failure is surging in vaccinated people (T0160.002: Information is False). The study examined myocarditis cases following COVID-19 vaccination, but its findings are consistent with those reported in previous studies, and it didn’t mention heart failure.<br><br>While COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are associated with rare cases of myocarditis, particularly in young males, COVID-19 itself is associated with a greater risk of myocarditis, along with other complications. On balance, the benefits of the vaccines outweigh their risks.</i> |

Similar claims circulated on Facebook and X, formerly Twitter.<br><br>Our rating: False<br><br>The study cited in the post does not conclude COVID-19 vaccines were linked to the excess deaths (T0163.002: Narrative Misrepresents Findings of Cited Academic Research). It encouraged further studies to identify the causes.<br><br>Excess deaths remain high with no cause identified<br><br>The study referenced in the post and article was published June 3 in BMJ Public Health, a publication of the British Medical Journal. In it, researchers from the Netherlands stated that excess mortality in Western nations remained high from 2020 to 2022, even after the adoption of preventative measures and vaccines to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19.<br><br>While noting the correlation, the study was explicit in its conclusion – and the British Medical Journal reiterated in a follow-up statement – that the research did not identify a cause of the excess deaths.<br><br>“Excess mortality has remained high in the Western World for three consecutive years, despite the implementation of containment measures and COVID-19 vaccines,” the study’s conclusion reads. “This raises serious concerns. Government leaders and policymakers need to thoroughly investigate underlying causes of persistent excess mortality.”<br><br>As the misrepresentation of the report spread, the British Medical Journal released a statement further stressing that researchers didn't identify a cause for the excess deaths.<br><br>“The researchers looked only at trends in excess mortality over time, not its causes,” the statement said in part. “While the researchers recognize that side effects are reported after vaccination, the research does not support the claim that vaccines are a major contributory factor to excess deaths since the start of the pandemic. Vaccines have, in fact, been instrumental in reducing the severe illness and death associated with COVID-19 infection.”<br><br>The statement also notes that different methods of data reporting and varying data quality from nation to nation further complicate identifying causal relationships.</i> |
| [I00182 No, CDC COVID-19 vaccine data doesn't link shot to shorter life span | Fact check](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00182.md) | <i>A Sept. 4 Instagram post (direct link, archive link) shows a screenshot of a post on X, formerly Twitter, that claims a particular vaccine has been linked to shorter lifespans.<br><br>"BREAKING: According to new CDC data, the Covid vaccine could take 24 years off of your life," reads the post.<br><br>The post was liked more than 1,000 times in two weeks. The X post appears to have been deleted.<br><br>There is no evidence any data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a link between COVID-19 vaccines and lower life expectancy. The dataset cited in a related article wasn't released until months after the claim was made. The claim originated with a website that frequently publishes misinformation.<br><br>The claim appears to stem from a Feb. 8 article posted on a website called "The Expose," which has previously published vaccine-related misinformation.<br><br>The article cites a study that looked at the effectiveness of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine among Cleveland Clinic employees. The study found the vaccine "afforded modest protection overall" when given to working-age adults. It did not address life expectancy (T0163.002: Narrative Misrepresents Findings of Cited Academic Research).<br><br>The article also claims the CDC's all-cause mortality data shows "each vaccine dose" increased mortality by 7% from 2021 to 2022. However, provisional mortality data for 2022 from the CDC wasn't released until May 5, nearly three months after the article was published (T0164.001: Narrative Presents Fabricated Statistics as Genuine Data). It says the "overall age-adjusted U.S. death rate decreased by 5.3% from 2021 to 2022."</i> |
