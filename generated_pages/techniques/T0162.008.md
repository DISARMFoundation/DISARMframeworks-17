| [I00157 Edited video of Bihar politician Tejashwi Yadav used to claim he was ‘drunk’ during media briefing](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00157.md) | <i>Social media users have shared a video claiming that Tejashwi Yadav, Bihar politician and chairman of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), was inebriated during a media address. The 43-second video, circulated on X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube, shows Yadav speaking slowly and appearing to slur his words while addressing reporters.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Using the logo in the viral clip and Hindi keywords from Yadav’s statement, we located the original video on the Indian news outlet Republic Bharat’s YouTube channel. Uploaded on June 11, 2024, under the title "What did Tejashwi Yadav say when taking a dig at the division of ministries (translated from Hindi)?”, the video is only 30 seconds long and does not show Yadav slurring or speaking slowly.<br><br>When we slowed down the playback speed of this video to 0.75x, we observed that it matched the slurred and slowed effect seen in the now-viral videos. Additionally, the edited video length matches the 43-second duration of the circulated clips. A comparison reveals that social media users utilized an edited, slowed-down version of the video to propagate a false claim (T0162.008: Context Reframed by Edits to Media, T0165.003: Playback Speed Altered).<br><br>[...]<br><br>A user on X shared the clip with the caption, “Tejasvi Yadav, Ex-Deputy CM- Bihar. Drunk. & (sic) Bihar is Dry State (No Alcohol). Jhum Barabar Jhum (keep on dancing)”.</i> |
| [I00158 Was Capitol Rioter in Horns and Furs an Antifa Instigator Who Took Part in BLM Protests?](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00158.md) | <i>In the aftermath of unprecedented rioting in the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, attention turned to identifying those responsible, many of whom were photographed in the course of their criminal actions, and some of whom even recorded their own involvement in selfies and social media live streams.<br><br>One of the individuals who featured prominently in press photographs and video footage from the rioting was a shirtless man who wore horns and furs on his head and had a painted face and tattoos on his body.<br><br>Beginning on the afternoon of the riots, social media users and conspiracy theorists shared photographs of the man, Arizona resident Jake Angeli, juxtaposed to suggest that he had previously taken part in demonstrations organized by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and therefore was not, in fact, a supporter of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump, but rather an agent provocateur or adherent to the antifa (anti-fascist) movement, seeking to discredit Trump supporters and efforts to overturn the victory of President-elect Joe Biden in the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election.<br><br>[...]<br><br>On Facebook, users widely shared a screenshot that included two photographs of Angeli, along with the caption "AZ [Arizona] BLM rally in June, DC Capital [sic] in January":<br><br>Some social media users explicitly presented the photographs as proof that Angeli was "antifa" and "not MAGA." In reality, Angeli is an enthusiastic supporter of Trump with a long public record of promoting the bizarre and baseless "QAnon" cluster of conspiracy theories.<br><br>The photograph on the right of the tweet — which was originally published by Trump supporter Cari Kelemen — showed Angeli taking part in the Capitol riots on Jan. 6, 2021. It was cropped from a larger photograph taken by Saul Loeb and published by Getty (T0162.008: Context Reframed by Edits to Media, T0165.002: Cropped Content).<br><br>The photograph shown on the left of the widely shared screenshot did show Angeli at a BLM demonstration in the summer of 2020, but it was cropped to occlude the fact that he was carrying a pro-QAnon sign, and failed to mention that Angeli had reportedly gone there not to take part in the main event, but to recruit others to his causes (T0162.008: Context Reframed by Edits to Media, T0165.002: Cropped Content).<br><br>It appears to have been taken by Brett Lewis, who emphasized on Twitter on Jan. 6 that Kelemen and others had misleadingly cropped it so that it no longer showed the QAnon-themed placard that Angeli was holding at the time. Lewis further explained that Angeli attended the BLM march in order to instigate conflict, not to join in the messages of other participants</i> |
| [I00159 Obama's speech on 'disinformation as a threat to democracy' taken out of context](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00159.md) | <i>Several posts on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook have shared an approximately 40-second clip of a speech by former U.S. President Barack Obama. In the clip, he states, "You just have to flood a country’s public square with enough raw sewage. You just have to raise enough questions, spread enough dirt, and plant enough conspiracy theorizing that citizens no longer know what to believe. Once they lose trust in their leaders, in mainstream media, in political institutions, in each other, in the possibility of truth, the game’s won."<br><br>The captions accompanying these posts quote parts of his speech, with some labeling Obama as a villain and insinuating that he advocates for using conspiracy theories to manipulate people through disinformation.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The clips of Obama’s speech, however, have been taken out of context, creating the false impression that he is endorsing disinformation. In reality, Obama was addressing how authoritarian leaders worldwide utilize disinformation as a weapon against democratic nations (T0162.009: Statement Reframed by Removal from Context, T0162.008: Context Reframed by Edits to Media).<br><br>A keyword search revealed that the clip was extracted from Obama's keynote address at Stanford University on April 21, 2022. The address focused on the dangers of disinformation to democracy.<br><br>Following this lead, we found the full speech on Youtube, uploaded by multiple channels. The relevant clip appears between 31:38 and 32:16 in the video (T0165.001: Clipped Content).</i> |
