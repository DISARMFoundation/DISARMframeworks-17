In cases where a screenshot of a title is posted, users are unable to view the rest of the content for context. Titles which misrepresent content can then mislead people into believing false information. <br><br>Fact Checkers have observed cases where viral information could be debunked simply by checking the article (common for headlines produced by satirical media outlets).<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts will need to review the article or video and make the assessment as to whether its title accurately reflects its content.
