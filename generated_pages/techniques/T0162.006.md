# Technique T0162.006: AI-Generated Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality

**Summary**: Synthetic content created using generative AI tools (e.g., deepfakes, AI image, video, or audio) is incorrectly presented as a depiction of real-world material; i.e. captured by a camera, a recording device, or otherwise manually produced by a human without the use of AI.<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts need to identify that content shared has been AI-Generated, and that it was presented in the context of the media showing real life (e.g. posted alongside text which treats or reacts to the content as legitimate).<br><br>As AI continues to develop capability to produce more realistic media, it is difficult to provide a list of methods to spot materials that have been created using AI which will not rapidly become outdated; platforms providing AI media generation are attempting to make the materials they produce indistinguishable from media made by humans. <br><br>At the same time, organisations create tools designed to help identify AI-generated content, and publish resources listing the latest tells and identifiers for AI-generated content. Analysts may look for such tools or resources to help identify the use of AI.

| [T0166 AI-Generated Content](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0166.md) | T0166: AI-Generated Content which has been published alongside material which implies or directly claims that the AI-Generated Content is actually a depiction of the real world (i.e. captured by a camera, a recording device, or otherwise manually produced by a human without the use of AI) should be documented using T0162.006: AI-Generated Content Incorrectly Presented as Depicting Reality. <br><br>There are times where T0166: AI-Generated Content is published without any claim it has been produced without the use of AI, or is even disclaimed as AI, but still is mistakenly perceived as an accurate depiction of the real world (i.e. captured by a camera, a recording device, or otherwise manually produced by a human without the use of AI). Such cases can be documented using T0166: AI-Generated Content. |
