| [I00118 ‘War Thunder’ players are once again leaking sensitive military technology information on a video game forum](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00118.md) | Researchers at Mozilla examined influence operations targeting Kenyan citizens on Twitter in 2021, providing “a grim window into the booming and shadowy industry of Twitter influencers for political hire here in Kenya”, and giving insight into operations’ operationalisation:<br><br><i>In our interviews with one of the influencers, they informed us of the agile tactics they use to organize and avoid detection. For example, when it’s time to carry out the campaign the influencers would be added to a Whatsapp group. Here, they received direction about what to post, the hashtags to use, which tweets to engage with and who to target. Synchronizing the tweets was also incredibly important for them. It’s what enables them to achieve their goal of trending on Twitter and gain amplification.<br><br>[...]<br><br>They revealed to us that those participating in the exercise are paid roughly between $10 and $15 to participate in three campaigns per day. Each campaign execution involves tweeting about the hashtags of the day until it appears on the trending section of Twitter. Additionally, some individuals have managed to reach retainer level and get paid about $250 per month. Their job is to make sure the campaigns are executed on a day-by-day basis with different hashtags.</i><br><br>An M-PESA account (T0148.002: Bank Account Asset, T0148.001: Online Banking Platform) was used to pay campaign participants.<br><br>Participants were organised in WhatsApp groups (T0129.005: Coordinate on Encrypted/Closed Networks, T0151.007: Chat Broadcast Group, T0151.004: Chat Platform), in which they planned how to get campaign content trending on Twitter (T0121: Manipulate Platform Algorithm, T0151.008: Microblogging Platform). |
| [I00125 The Agency](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00125.md) | Discord is an example of a T0151.004: Chat Platform, which allows users to create their own T0151.005: Chat Community Server. The Institute for Strategic Dialog (ISD) conducted an investigation into the extreme right’s usage of Discord servers:<br><br><i>Discord is a free service accessible via phones and computers. It allows users to talk to each other in real time via voice, text or video chat and emerged in 2015 as a platform designed to assist gamers in communicating with each other while playing video games. The popularity of the platform has surged in recent years, and it is currently estimated to have 140 million monthly active users.<br><br>Chatrooms – known as servers - in the platform can be created by anyone, and they are used for a range of purposes that extend far beyond gaming. Such purposes include the discussion of extreme right-wing ideologies and the planning of offline extremist activity. Ahead of the far-right Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, organisers used Discord to plan and promote events and posted swastikas and praised Hitler in chat rooms with names like “National Socialist Army” and “Führer’s Gas Chamber”.</i><br><br>In this example a Discord server was used to organise the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right rally. Chat rooms such in the server were used to discuss different topics related to the rally (T0057: Organise Events, T0126.002: Facilitate Logistics or Support for Attendance, T0151.004: Chat Platform, T0151.005: Chat Community Server, T0151.006: Chat Room).<br><br><i>Another primary activity engaged in the servers analysed are raids against other servers associated with political opponents, and in particular those that appear to be pro-LGBTQ. Raids are a phenomenon in which a small group of users will join a Discord server with the sole purpose of spamming the host with offensive or incendiary messages and content with the aim of upsetting local users or having the host server banned by Discord. On two servers examined here, raiding was their primary function.<br><br>Among servers devoted to this activity, specific channels were often created to host links to servers that users were then encouraged to raid. Users are encouraged to be as offensive as possible with the aim of upsetting or angering users on the raided server, and channels often had content banks of offensive memes and content to be shared on raided servers.<br><br>The use of raids demonstrates the gamified nature of extremist activity on Discord, where use of the platform and harassment of political opponents is itself turned into a type of real-life video game designed to strengthen in-group affiliation. This combined with the broader extremist activity identified in these channels suggests that the combative activity of raiding could provide a pathway for younger people to become more engaged with extremist activity.</i><br><br>Discord servers were used by members of the extreme right to coordinate harassment of targeted communities (T0048: Harass, T0049.005: Conduct Swarming, T0151.004: Chat Platform, T0151.005: Chat Community Server). |

Millions of People Were Fooled](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00242.md) | <i>Williams, best known to audiences for his iconic role as Star Wars’ Lando Calrissian, announced Sunday that he had been hacked and that a number of recent politically-charged posts on his page were not his own (T0146: Account Asset, T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0145.005: Compromised Persona).<br><br>“My friends, I want to let you know that my account was recently hacked,” Williams wrote on Facebook Sunday. “Several unauthorized posts were not legitimate.”<br><br>Facebook post data compiled by PressProgress shows that over a three-day period between September 10 and September 13, Williams’ official verified Facebook page made 66 posts in reference to Charlie Kirk. These posts were collectively shared over 70,000 times and received over 1.6 million likes and other reactions.<br><br>Williams had been an infrequent social media user until September 10, when the 88-year-old actor’s Facebook page suddenly posted a “May the Fourth be with you” message to confused fans, prompting one to reply: “It’s September, Billy.”<br><br>For three days, the Star Wars actor’s page became obsessively fixated on Charlie Kirk’s murder (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis), posting dozens of times per day about Kirk, including posts equating the slain activist to Abraham Lincoln, JFK, Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesus Christ. Another post predicted retribution against “leftists.”<br><br>[...]<br><br>In a statement to PressProgress on Saturday afternoon, Billy Dee Williams’ management team confirmed that the Star Wars actor’s Facebook page had been compromised and that they were having difficulty regaining control.<br><br>“Unfortunately Mr. Williams’ official Facebook account was hacked,” the actor’s representative told PressProgress. “Please note that all of the recent posts you’ve seen are fraudulent and in no way reflect Mr. Williams’ views, opinions or affiliations.” (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution)<br><br>[...]<br><br>One post, shared while police were still hunting for the suspect, provided the wrong name of the alleged shooter (T0068: Respond to Breaking News Event or Active Crisis, T0160.002: Information is False). Another post shared a fake screenshot of a non-existent tweet from Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger lamenting the death of Charlie Kirk and predicting the return of Jesus Christ (T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).</i> |
| [I00243 Czech prime minister says his X account was hacked ‘from abroad’](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00243.md) | <i>The Czech prime minister’s account on the social media platform X was hacked on Tuesday, with a series of false messages posted, including those claiming a Russian attack on Czech soldiers and a response to U.S. tariffs (T0146: Account Asset, T0097.111: Government Official Persona,  T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0145.005: Compromised Persona, T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution). <br><br>Petr Fiala confirmed the incident, saying the hack originated “from abroad.”<br><br>“Despite thorough security measures, including two-factor authentication … the attackers managed to penetrate the profiles and publish fake posts,” he said. “We are actively cooperating with the police to investigate this incident and identify the perpetrators.”<br><br>One of the posts alleged that Russian forces had attacked Czech military units near the border of Kaliningrad, a heavily militarized Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania. The post was later deleted.<br><br>"The post about the attack on Czech soldiers is not true," government spokesperson Lucie Michut Jesatkova told local media.<br><br>The prime minister’s X account, which has more than 366,000 followers, also briefly displayed a post about preparing sanctions in response to U.S. tariffs. According to local reports, both fake posts included a live video link, which turned out to be a static image with no audio.<br><br>Similar fake content appeared on the X account of Spolu, a center-right political alliance that includes Fiala’s Civic Democratic Party (ODS) (T0146: Account Asset, T0097.111: Government Official Persona,  T0150.005: Compromised Asset, T0145.005: Compromised Persona, T0161.002: Statement Incorrectly Presented as Made by Individual or Institution).<br><br>“We reacted immediately and are working with experts to analyze the attack. High security of our channels is a priority for us,” said ODS spokesperson Jakub Skyva.<br><br>Petr Letocha, a member of the Czech parliament’s security committee, told local media that the breach may have involved someone with administrative access to both accounts.<br><br>“Given that the [prime minister's] account is fully under control again, I believe the attacker no longer has access to it,” he said, adding that two-factor authentication makes such breaches difficult and the investigation may clarify how it was bypassed.<br><br>Czech police confirmed they are investigating the breach to determine how it occurred and whether the false information posted could constitute a criminal offense.</i> |
