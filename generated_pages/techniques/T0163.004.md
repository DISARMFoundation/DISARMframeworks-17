# Technique T0163.004: Narrative Cites Academic Research not Peer Reviewed

**Summary**: A narrative makes a claim, and points to academic research to back up the legitimacy of the claim - however, the research has not been peer reviewed, and this is not disclosed.<br><br>Peer review is an important part of the scientific process. It involves submitting research to other accredited experts to confirm that the researchers have conducted their investigation correctly, and following established scientific best practices (such as minimising bias, accurately reporting findings, or honesty about potential failings in research methods). Without peer review, unverified or inaccurate information could easily make its way into scientific consensus. <br><br>Some academic journals publish preliminary summaries of research (i.e. previews of results before they have been peer reviewed), which can be erroneously cited as completed research.<br><br>It is not the case that all information needs to be peer reviewed, people can share the results of research which hasn’t been peer reviewed, and this information can be valid and useful. But narratives which make claims referencing academic research which has not been peer reviewed (and do not highlight that data hasn’t been peer reviewed) can lead to the spread of misleading or incorrect information.<br><br>To count as a citation, the content must explicitly point to a specific piece of academic research to support a claim. This could be via an embedded link, footnotes, or providing the name of a paper, the journal it appears in, and the researchers who produced it.<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts need to look at the cited report, and confirm that it has not been peer reviewed.

| [I00178 Research summary misleadingly cited as evidence Covid-19 shots are dangerous](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00178.md) | <i>A preliminary summary of research in an American Heart Association (AHA) journal claiming that common Covid-19 vaccines more than double the risk of heart problems is being cited as evidence the shots are dangerous. But the AHA says there are potential errors in the research, which has not been peer reviewed (T0163.004: Narrative Cites Academic Research not Peer Reviewed), and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an expert raised questions about its conclusion and methodology.<br><br>"Mrna COVID Vaccines Dramatically Increase Endothelial Inflammatory Markers and ACS Risk as Measured by the PULS Cardiac Test: a Warning," says the title of the abstract, which was published on November 8, 2021 on the website of the AHA journal Circulation.<br><br>The summary -- known as an abstract -- of the research by heart surgeon Steven Gundry says there is an increased five-year risk of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in patients, from 11 percent pre-vaccination to 25 percent after vaccination.<br><br>The abstract has been cited in multiple online articles raising concerns about the shots, and has also circulated on social media.<br><br>The research focuses on mRNA shots, which use technology that differs from traditional vaccines, and have been the subject of a number of inaccurate claims debunked by AFP Fact Check.<br><br>Shortly after the publication of the abstract, the AHA issued an expression of concern about the research by Gundry, who declined through a spokeswoman to comment on the issue.<br><br>"Soon after publication of the above abstract in Circulation, it was brought to the American Heart Association Committee on Scientific Sessions Program's attention that there are potential errors in the abstract," the AHA said.<br><br>"Specifically, there are several typographical errors, there is no data in the abstract regarding myocardial T-cell infiltration, there are no statistical analyses for significance provided, and the author is not clear that only anecdotal data was used," it added.<br><br>Michelle Kirkwood, the AHA's media relations director, told AFP that abstracts are not peer reviewed, meaning they have not been assessed by other scientists prior to publication.</i> |
| [I00179 Digging into the math of a study attacking the safety of the abortion pill](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00179.md) | <i>The Ethics and Public Policy Center, a think tank that says it opposes “the extreme progressive agenda while building consensus of conservatives,” recently issued a report on a key abortion medication, mifepristone, that it says raises questions about its safety. After analyzing insurance claims for more than 865,000 prescribed mifepristone abortions, the group said it had determined that almost 11 percent of women experienced a “serious adverse event,” much higher than an overall 0.5 percent rate found in clinical studies.<br><br>That headline number led Republicans like Sen. Josh Hawley (Missouri) to declare that the abortion pill is dangerous. “Those are astounding, jaw-dropping numbers, and they have been largely hidden from the public,” he said in an opinion article in the Federalist. An adverse health event, he noted, is “a major, potentially life-threatening medical disaster. We’re talking about things like sepsis, infection, and hemorrhaging, the kind of things that land you in an ER.”<br><br>Citing the report, Hawley on Thursday secured a commitment from Jim O’Neill, the Trump administration nominee for deputy secretary of Health and Human Services, to review the safety of mifepristone.<br><br>A medication abortion using a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol in 2023 accounted for 63 percent of abortions, double the percentage in 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Since 1988, about 100 countries have approved the use of mifepristone, according to Gynuity Health Projects, which also favors abortion rights.<br><br>We dug into the EPPC report, which calls the use of mifepristone “chemical abortions,” and posed 20 questions to EPPC, which were answered in detail via email by spokesman Hunter Estes after consultation with the researchers. The report lists 94,605 adverse events, for a rate of 10.93 percent, between 2017 and 2023. (Some women had more than one event, so the report says it avoided double-counting when calculating overall rate.) But the headline number seems less solid when the individual data presented in the report is examined.<br><br>We should note that, unlike most credible medical studies, the report did not undergo a formal external peer review before publication (T0163.004: Narrative Cites Academic Research not Peer Reviewed). Estes said “the study was internally reviewed and adjudicated by a panel of physicians, who carefully evaluated the clinical classifications, coding, and outcome assessments to ensure medical accuracy and consistency.”</i> |
