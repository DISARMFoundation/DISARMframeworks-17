# Technique T0162.009: Statement Reframed by Removal from Context

**Summary**: A statement legitimately made by an individual or institution has been taken out of its original context which reframes its meaning (sometimes referred to as “Quote Mining”). <br><br>For example, an individual may have been performing a speech in which they were quoting a statement made by a political opponent. By editing out the context that they were quoting an opponent, the speaker can be made to look like they were making the statement themselves. <br><br>To make this assertion, analysts need to identify the original source of a statement (e.g. written argument, video interview, podcast, etc), and confirm that in its original context it has a different meaning, or interpretation.
