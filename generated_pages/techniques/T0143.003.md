| Associated Technique | Description |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| [T0097 Present Persona](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0097.md) | Analysts can use the sub-techniques of T0097: Presented Persona to categorise the type of impersonation. For example, a document developed by a threat actor which falsely presented as a letter from a government department could be documented using T0085.004: Develop Document, T0143.003: Impersonated Persona, and T0097.206: Government Institution Persona. |
| [T0145.001 Copy Account Imagery](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0145.001.md) | Actors may take existing accounts’ profile pictures as part of their impersonation efforts. |
| [T0145.005 Illustrated Character Account Imagery](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0145.005.md) | T0145.005: Compromised Persona differs to T0143.003: Impersonated Persona in that an Impersonated Persona exists on an asset which was never controlled by the individual or institution the actor is impersonating, whereas a Compromised Persona is used to document actions taken by an actor while maintaining the persona of an asset they have compromised. |
| [T0161.001 Impersonated Content](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0161.001.md) | T0161.001: Impersonated Content differs from T0143.003: Impersonated Persona in that T0143.003: Impersonated Persona is used to document Assets which are impersonating another individual or institution (i.e. the asset is falsely presenting itself as being controlled by another entity), where T0161.001: Impersonated Content is used to document Content (i.e. Video, Audio, Text, Image) which has been produced to look like it was made by another individual or institution.<br><br>For example, a website which falsely presents itself as being controlled by an existing news outlet would be documented using T0143.003: Impersonated Persona, an article it publishes which falsely presents itself as being made by the same news outlet would be documented using T0161.001: Impersonated Content.<br><br>T0161.001: Impersonated Content does not always appear alongside T0143.003: Impersonated Persona, as T0161.001: Impersonated Content is often published by assets presenting as individuals unrelated to the impersonated individual or institution. |

At first glance, Powell’s Twitter timeline looks like it belongs to a young and eager reporter amplifying her interests. But her profile photo is a stock image, and many of her links go to the propaganda sites.<br><br>“Powell, who joined the platform just last month, shares links to stories from major US news media outlets, retweets local news about Washington, DC, and regularly promotes content from The Foreign Code and The Economy Club. Other fake journalist accounts behaved similarly to Powell and had generic descriptions.

Many of the images searched were found to be appropriated from genuine social media profiles or sites such as Pinterest. When this was the case, the account was marked as confirmed to be inauthentic.

It’s what enables them to achieve their goal of trending on Twitter and gain amplification.<br><br>[...]<br><br>They revealed to us that those participating in the exercise are paid roughly between $10 and $15 to participate in three campaigns per day. Each campaign execution involves tweeting about the hashtags of the day until it appears on the trending section of Twitter.

NRM are the only group in the sample examined by ISD known to have engaged in terrorist attacks. Swedish members of the group conducted a series of bombings in Gothenburg in 2016 and 2017, and several Finnish members are under investigation in relation to both violent attacks and murder.<br><br>The NRM Steam group does not host content related to gaming, and instead seems to act as a hub for the movement. The group’s overview section contains a link to the official NRM website, and users are encouraged to find like-minded people to join the group. The group is relatively small, with 87 members, but at the time of writing, it appeared to be active and in use. Interestingly, although the group is in Finnish language, it has members in common with the English language channels identified in this analysis.

The comments section of said target group show that neo-Nazi and antisemitic comments were consistently posted in the group just two minutes after the instruction had been posted in the extremist group, highlighting the swiftness with which racially motivated harassment can be directed online.</i><br><br>Threat actors used social groups on Steam to organise harassment of targets (T0152.009: Software Delivery Platform, T0151.002: Online Community Group, T0049.005: Conduct Swarming, T0048: Harass). |
