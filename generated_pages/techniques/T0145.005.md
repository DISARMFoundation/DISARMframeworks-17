# Technique T0145.005: Illustrated Character Account Imagery

**Summary**: A cartoon/illustrated/anime character used in account imagery.<br><br> An influence operation might flesh out its account by uploading account imagery (e.g. a profile picture), increasing its perceived authenticity.<br><br> People sometimes legitimately use images of illustrated characters as their profile picture, and threat actors can mimic this behaviour to avoid the risk of detection associated with stealing or AI-generating profile pictures (see T0145.001: Copy Account Imagery and T0145.002: AI-Generated Account Imagery).<br><br> This Technique is often used by Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour accounts (CIBs). A collection of accounts displaying the same behaviour using similar account imagery can indicate the presence of CIB.

| Associated Technique | Description |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| [T0143.003 Impersonated Persona](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0143.003.md) | T0145.005: Compromised Persona differs to T0143.003: Impersonated Persona in that an Impersonated Persona exists on an asset which was never controlled by the individual or institution the actor is impersonating, whereas a Compromised Persona is used to document actions taken by an actor while maintaining the persona of an asset they have compromised. |
| [T0150.005 Compromised Asset](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0150.005.md) | A Compromised Persona can only exist on a Compromised Asset which previously housed an Authentic Persona. However, Assets which are Compromised are not always used to take action under a Compromised Persona. Sometimes Compromised Assets are taken and rebranded as a new Inauthentic Persona, because their activity is less likely to be flagged by automated moderation systems as suspicious compared to Newly Created Assets. |
