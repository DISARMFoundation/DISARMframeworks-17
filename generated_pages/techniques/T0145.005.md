# Technique T0145.005: Compromised Persona

**Summary**: Assets which legitimately belong to individuals or institutions with established personas can be compromised (i.e. hacked, or otherwise taken over) and controlled by an actor. The actor can take actions with the asset while maintaining the established persona - effectively presenting the actions as having been taken by the asset’s original owner.<br><br>This Sub-Technique is used to document actions taken by threat actors while in control of a compromised asset, and maintaining the persona of the original asset owner’s persona.<br><br>For example, a celebrity’s account could be hacked, and made to post a bitcoin scam, taking advantage of their followers’ faith in the celebrity, and their knowledge that the account legitimately belongs to them (even though, unawares to them, the celebrity is not in control of the asset at that moment - their persona has been compromised).

| [T0143.003 Impersonated Persona](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0143.003.md) | T0145.005: Compromised Persona differs to T0143.003: Impersonated Persona in that an Impersonated Persona exists on an asset which was never controlled by the individual or institution the actor is impersonating, whereas a Compromised Persona is used to document actions taken by an actor while maintaining the persona of an asset they have compromised. |

| [T0150.005 Compromised Asset](../../generated_pages/techniques/T0150.005.md) | A Compromised Persona can only exist on a Compromised Asset which previously housed an Authentic Persona. However, Assets which are Compromised are not always used to take action under a Compromised Persona. Sometimes Compromised Assets are taken and rebranded as a new Inauthentic Persona, because their activity is less likely to be flagged by automated moderation systems as suspicious compared to Newly Created Assets. |
